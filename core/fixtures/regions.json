The Appalachian Mountains are the defining characteristic of the area, including the state\u2019s highest point at Brasstown Bald. The largest cities in the region include Athens, Gainesville, Rome, and Dalton.\n\nThe Cherokee people were among the earliest settlers to the area. In the 1820s, the discovery of gold in Lumpkin County led to the first gold rush in the state and one of the earliest gold rushes in the nation\u2019s history. The event led to the increased settlement of Americans in north Georgia and the Cherokee were forcibly removed in the 1830s. Some of the most significant battles of the Civil War were fought in north Georgia between 1861 and 1865, including Kennesaw Mountain, Chickamauga, and the early battles of General William T. Sherman\u2019s Atlanta Campaign.\n\nNorth Georgia has since developed into a tourist destination. The beauty of the mountainous landscape is a major attraction to the area. Hiking enthusiasts are drawn to the Appalachian Trail\u2019s southern terminus point at Springer Mountain in Georgia\u2019s Chattahoochee National Forest. Northern Georgia is also home to the state\u2019s largest university, the University of Georgia, in Athens; the largest carpet industry in the world in Dalton; and the alpine-themed city of Helen.\n\nAdditional newspapers from this region are available in the <a href='http://ngnewspapers.galileo.usg.edu'>North Georgia Historic Newspapers Archive</a> and the <a href='http://athnewspapers.galileo.usg.edu'>Athens Historic Newspapers Archive</a>.",

    "homepage_copy": "West Georgia is the area of the state bordering central Alabama. Although there are no official designations for the region, it is generally located west of Atlanta and runs parallel to the Chattahoochee River. The largest cities in west Georgia include Columbus, Newnan, Carrollton, LaGrange, and Douglasville.\n\nAs with many other regions of the state, the Creek Indians were the dominant group of settlers before the arrival of European explorers. The Creeks were eventually coerced to sign away their lands in western Georgia in the 1820s to make way for American expansion. Columbus (established in 1828) grew significantly in the following decades, becoming one Georgia\u2019s largest cities with the support of the mill industry. During the Civil War, the area was the home to numerous Confederate hospitals and suffered from the destruction of General William Sherman\u2019s March to the Sea. After the war, west Georgia experienced significant development due to the expansion of railroads and the cotton textile industry in the area.\n\nWest Georgia is famously home to the city of Warm Springs, where President Franklin Roosevelt established a polio treatment center and built a home dubbed the \u201cLittle White House\u201d during his presidency. Roosevelt died in 1945 during one of his many stays in the city. Additionally, President Jimmy Carter was a peanut farmer in Plains and continues to live in Sumter County. Habitat for Humanity, an internationally renowned home-building charity, began in 1976 in nearby Americus. In the second half of the twentieth century, metropolitan Atlanta increasingly expanded into western Georgia, fueling growth in the area. Columbus has grown into the second largest city in the state due largely to the nearby presence of Fort Benning. The region has also seen booms of the warehouse distribution and manufacturing industries, bringing further development to West Georgia.\n\nAdditional newspapers from this region are available in the <a href='http://wgnewspapers.galileo.usg.edu'>West Georgia Historic Newspapers Archive</a>.",

The region borders Alabama to the west, South Carolina to the east and Florida to the south, and includes the Okefenokee Swamp and Georgia\u2019s one-hundred-and-ten-mile Atlantic coast. The largest cities in south Georgia include Savannah, Albany, Valdosta, and Statesboro.\n\nThe Creek Confederation was the largest group of inhabitants in southern Georgia when the English arrived in the area in the eighteenth century. James Oglethorpe founded Savannah as the first city in the newly established Georgia colony. The city served as capital of Georgia until 1786. During the Civil War, the Confederacy established the Andersonville Prison in Macon County. The prison was infamous for its treatment of Union prisoners of war, who were subjected to starvation and disease. South Georgia was a focus of the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, including the Albany Movement, a widely-publicized effort to desegregate the city that involved the participation of Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nSouth Georgia remains a largely agricultural area of the state. The principal crops in the region include blueberries, peanuts, cotton, Vidalia onions, and peaches. South Georgia is also home to the barrier islands along the coast, Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, and the birthplace of baseball legend Jackie Robinson in Cairo.\n\nAdditional newspapers from this region are available in the <a href='http://sgnewspapers.galileo.usg.edu'>South Georgia Historic Newspapers Archive</a> and the <a href='http://savnewspapers.galileo.usg.edu'>Savannah Historic Newspapers Archive</a>",

The area comprises the geographic center of the state and is generally located south of Atlanta along the fall line between the Flint and Oconee Rivers. Some of the largest cities in central Georgia include Warner Robins, Milledgeville, Dublin, and Perry.\n\nThe earliest settlers in the region were the people of the Creek Confederacy, whose ancestry can be traced to the mound building civilizations of pre-European exploration. Middle Georgia\u2019s largest city, Macon, began as Fort Hawkins in Creek territory. After American settlers removed the Creek people beginning in the 1820s, Macon grew into one of the largest cities in the state due largely to the cotton trade. Another central Georgia city, Milledgeville, served as the state capital beginning in 1804. Milledgeville remained the capital during the Civil War and was temporarily occupied by General Sherman during his 1864 Atlanta Campaign. Following the end of the war, government officials moved the capital to Atlanta in 1868.\n\nMiddle Georgia\u2019s continued growth in the twentieth century was driven largely by the establishment of Robins Air Force Base in the city of Warner Robins during World War II. The area remains culturally significant and has been the home to numerous nationally renowned writers and musicians, including Alice Walker, Joel Chandler Harris, Flannery O\u2019Connor, Otis Redding, the Allman Brothers, Blind Willie McTell, and Little Richard.\n\nAdditional newspapers from this region are available in the <a href='http://telegraph.galileo.usg.edu'><i>Macon Telegraph</i> Archive</a> and the <a href='http://mercercluster.galileo.usg.edu'><i>Mercer Cluster</i> Archive</a>.",

The region, along with western South Carolina, is often referred to as the CSRA (Central Savannah River Area). East Georgia\u2019s largest cities include Augusta, Martinez, and Evans.\n\nThe earliest settlers to the area include the Uchee, Westo, and Savannah peoples. James Oglethorpe established the region\u2019s first city, Augusta, in 1736. The city was held by the British during most of the Revolutionary War. In the post-war period, east Georgia was home to two of Georgia\u2019s early capitals, Augusta (1785-1796) and Louisville (1796-1804). The Confederate Powder Works in Augusta produced millions of pounds of gunpowder during the war and was the only permanent structure erected by the Confederacy. During General William T. Sherman\u2019s March to the Sea, Union forces fought in and set fires to several east Georgia cities, including Sandersville, Millen, and Waynesboro.\n\nAs the third largest city in the state, Augusta has remained the economic engine for east Georgia. The city is home to the internationally renowned Masters Tournament at the Augusta National Golf Club, the Medical College of Georgia (the largest medical school in the state), and late soul legend James Brown. Plant Vogtle, Clarks Hill Lake, and the boyhood home of Woodrow Wilson are all also located in east Georgia.",

Atlanta is located in northwestern Georgia, south of the Appalachian Mountains and north of the fall line that runs from Columbus to Augusta.\n\nThe area was originally inhabited by the Creek and Cherokee peoples before the arrival of European and American settlers. After the forced removal of Native Americans in the 1830s, the establishment of several railroad lines brought white settlers into the town known as Terminus. The town was renamed Marthasville in 1843 before finally becoming Atlanta two years later. During the Civil War, General William T. Sherman\u2019s forces burned and destroyed the city during his March to the Sea. The city rapidly rebounded as people and railroads moved back into Atlanta in the post-war years and Atlanta quickly became Georgia\u2019s largest in the decades that followed. In 1868, the capital of Georgia moved to Atlanta and has remained there to the present day. Atlanta became a hub for the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. Under the leadership of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Martin Luther King, Jr. and many others, Atlanta became an example how a southern city could successfully desegregate government and public facilities.\n\nAtlanta became a travel hub and center of commerce in second half of the twentieth century. Suburban growth skyrocketed during that period, giving rise to large neighboring cities, including Sandy Springs, Roswell, Johns Creek, Alpharetta, Marietta, Smyrna, and Decatur. Atlanta is home to several sports franchises, the busiest airport in the country, and some of the most prestigious colleges and universities in the world. In 1996, Atlanta hosted the Summer Olympic Games, making it the first southern city and the third American city to do so.\n\nAdditional newspapers from this region are available in the <a href='http://israelite.galileo.usg.edu'>Southern Israelite Archive</a>.",
