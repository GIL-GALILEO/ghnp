MAKES SEVERAL OTHER
'SPEECHES DURING DAY
At Erie, Pa., the President
Outlines Plan of Compro
mise on the Arbitra
tion Treaties.
By Associated Prcs.
EHIE, Sept. J President Taft
ouded' the first of his forty-six
days of speech-making with au
address in. tho Auditorium hero
tonight. Before arriving be bad spent
nine hours in Syracuse.. N. Y., where he
made three speeches.
Tho president said he had determined
that his average during this trip would
bo four and a half speeches a day, so
he did not start out at lop speed.
Mr. Taft reserved his most import
ant uttcrunco of the day for the speech
here when he outlined a plan by which
ho hopes to wipe out objections in tho
United States senate to tho recently
negotiated treaties of arbitration with
Great Britain and France.
These treaties have been bold up and
threatened with defeat, largely because
several senators have contended that
the proposed joint high commission
which would determine whether or not
a question should bo scut to arbitra
tion practically robbed tho sonato oi
its function of passing upon the ques
tion. Suggests Compromise.
The president tonight suggested as a
compromise 'tbtrtlTlii? American "members
of Hiich a joint; commission should bo
confirmed by tho senate. He said he
saw no reason why they should not be,
if congress, or tho. senate, thought it
dangerous to trust tlio president only
to make the appointmeiita.
Mr. Taft indicated that he would go
further than this and be willing to
wipe out the joint " high commission
entirety, if need be, and loave.the de
cision as to whothcr a question is ar
bitral to a board of arbitration. Ho
also would be willing to havo this board
pass not only upon the merits of tho
question, bur. upon tho jurisdiction.
"Either wo arc in favor of arbitra
tion on issues which are likely to load
ijo war, or we aro not,'' ho exclaimed.
"Jf we aro in. favor of war as the
only means of settling questions of im
portance betwoen countries, then lot us
recognize it as a principle, and decline
all arbitration:, but if wo are really in
favor of arbitration as a- means of
avoiding war, then why should wc not
be willing to submit to impartial men
tho decision upon a question mthor
than to lenvo it to the result of a
bloody battle, in which, with a fair
cause, we may be beaten or with an
unjust cause wo may conquer?"
Biding His Time.
The president did not plunge direct
ly into a defonso of his administra
tion, as some of his hearers had ex
pected. One of tho most significant
things he said was at tho luncheon
with tho New York state fair commis
sioners at Syracuse, when ho explained
why he had not discussed reciprocity
in his outdoor address to several thou
sands of city folk and farmors.
"I-am not going to speak about reci
procity," he said, "until nfter the
matter is settled in Canada. We have
done "our part and we aro waiting, and
it is just as well for us to keep quiet."
Mr. Taft also explained in Syracuse
why he happened to decide upon this
13,000-mile jaunt to the Pacific and
through "tho enemy's countr.y" of in
surgency. This trip was just like
"Tonsy," ho said; "it .ist growod."
"Two years ago T promised Gover
nor Hughes to visit your state fnir.
Then I made an appointment with Con
crrcBsman Madison of Kansas to visit
Kansas and Hutchinson on tho semi
centennial of the state.
"These two engagement were the
reason of my downfall. Thereafter an
engagement in San Prnncisco accom
plished by completo .ruin. Now 1 have
before mo forty days of travel and T
do not know how many speeches, and
I ask your prayers Tor my survival."
Explains His Trip.
In further explanation of his trip, the
president said:'
'T expect to talk on this trip about
tho issues of the dav. and somo of my
policies if I may dignify my relation
to them by the noiSPssive case and
count them among tho issues of the
day. I hope I may he able tu bring i
somewhat more clearly from Uie stand
point of one who is charged with some
responsibility in respect of them, many
of the questions that perplex the legis
lators and executive at Washington."'
At the state fair grounds in l-yra-ciieo
the president found himself in tho
midst of one of the groa test crowds ever
gathered there, and estimated by somo
as in the neighborhood of 100,000. Ho
sharod honors with an aeroplanist who
was constantly' bu..ing over the heads
of the people, and several of the most
noted automobile rnoers in tho country.

N- 0 local news story published M
in recent years has caused B
so much com merit as the ex- 91
elusive story in yesterday's Trib- H
uue regarding the taking or! pho- juH
tographic views in the Salt Lako H
Mormon -temple, by secret meth- H
ods. It was for hours almost tho H
sole topic oi: conversation about B
the streets and mightily stirred n
the authorities of the church. The ffi
Organ of the Mormon church last Jtim
evening took account of the story H
to the extent of devoting two B
pages of space to a discussion of
the details. B
The most important development of B
tho day was thif identification, through H
efforts pf a Tribune representative, oC Sj
tho man who took tho views. JThis man It H
is Gilbert L. Bossard, a German con- H
vert to Mormonism. who fell out with Hi
tjio church authorities and secretly took H
the pictures in a spirit of revenge. B
Employed by Florence. B
While Bossard was employed for a B
long timo by Florence in His motion H
picture business, it is said by close
friends of ."Florence that Bossard took IB
the pictures on his own account and
without the advico or knowledge oi H
Florence. -It was oulv after tho views (D
h:fd boon obtained that Bossard told IB
Florence of his exploits, and the lat- H
ter, seeing an opportunity to turn them H
to commercial account, investigated the S
New York markot with a view of dis- nl
posing of them to postcard publishers V
and stereopticon view manufacturer;! 9j
should the church refuse to buy tho M
negatives. Bf
Came and Went at Will. B
It Is said that Bossard had no difficulty B
In gaining access to the temple and that
he devoted opportune hours for tho space IB
of a year to obtalnlntr tho views. Belnt? MB
still a member of the Mormon church so NBA
far as anything to tho contrary appeared, 9HI
Bossard. of course, could fco and come on wmhm
the same terms as any other member of fiBH
the church who visits the temple. Eml- BJ
nent lawyers In Salt .Lafce say that Bof- Wmm
sard Is not liable to prosecution for tak-
ing the views, and that the most serious H
charge that i-ould be placed against him Bt
would bo one of trespass. K
There wa3 a report yesterday that in- H
junction proceedings might he had to re- IV
strain r Florence from showing the pic- Wk
turcs. It was also reported that a charge H
or blackmail might bo brought against inf
Florence but whether such a chargo V
wouhl He is u matter of doubt, with tho mk
view preponderating that It would not. Bi
The text of tho letter received from B
Max Florence by President Josoph F- B
Smith was made public yesterday. Tn K
this letter Florence" declares that the jM
offer of the pictures to the Mormon ! fla
church is a strict, business proposition B
cud without sentiment. jwj
Threatens Publicity. B
Florence intimates that unless tin Bt
church buys his negatives he will exploit IB
the views In post cards and otherwise. B
and, by inference at least, says he sees jM
a fortune for himself In his pictorial pes- M f
sessions. Prosldent Smith also made pub- Ml
Hi tho text of the telegram which ho K i
sent to Florence. That message reads: H
"I will make no bargain with thieves, or Bj
