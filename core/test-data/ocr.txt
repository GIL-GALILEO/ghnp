Will Lay Off 150 Craft.
'§ Th* general tieup of craft in New-York Har
bor that has been threatened for the last two or
ireA days will not take place to-day. A con
ference was held yesterday afternoon between
"re preservatives of the New-York Central. th«
I>high Valley, the New- York, New-Haven and
Karl ford, the Erie, the Baltimore and Ohio, the
,'T;E Island, and the New-Jersey Central rail
"roads. and representatives of their engineers
r.t Local No. 33. Marine Engineers' Benefit
"Association, through which the demand for
lie her wages and shorter hours was submitted,
he representatives met at the office of W. G.
Eesler. the general manager of the Central Rail
[road of Jersey, No. 143 Llberty-st. It
Jm-as announced by Mr. Besler afterward that
.the offer to arbitrate the wages and conditions
'of service of the engineers had been accepted.
Louis L. Beinier. president of the association
Xtf the engineers, added that, except for those
n the tugs controlled by independent own
ers, who yesterday refused to arbitrate, none
I'of the engineers would try to tie up traffic In
the harbor to-day. The conference -was carried
[en apparently in the best of spirit, for Mr.
*inier, after it bad adjourned, thanked the
-railroad official?, which included W. 11. Bald
win, of the Long Island Railroad, and H. C. Da
3*al and W. B. Pollock, of the New- York Cen
tral Railroad, for the courteous treatment given.
The offer of the New- York Central Id regard to
'arbitration was that one person should bo se
icted by each side, these in case of a disagree
ment to select a third. The terms and hours
agreed on were to be binding on both, sides from
lay 1. So far as could be learned last night.
no arbitrators were selected. It was understood
.that May 15 had been selected as the limit for
jthe arrangement for arbitration.
* The New- York. New-Haven and Hartford
Railroad conceded the demands of Its engineers
plying on Long Island Sound, according to Mr.
ernier. The engineers of the boats that move
the immigrants had their demands granted yes
terday. As the ferryboats were not involved,
practically the only craft tied up to-day will be
one hundred and fifty tugs owned by indepen
dent towing companies, and the vessels of the
Cornhill Towing Company, which were laid up
yesterday.
The independent towing companies Intend to
fight. A meeting of the Association for the
Protection of Commerce of the Port of New-
York was held in the Produce Exchange yester
day. About one hundred owners of tow boats
and steamers were present. H. L. Joyce, vice
president of the association, said afterward:
We have simply reaffirmed cur action of the last
meeting; that is, we do not recognize the union.
but are willing to treat with all our engineers as
individuals. Secondly, we are willing in some ir
bunofts to advance the salaries of engineers, but
will not, under any circumstances, adopt the sched
ule asked by the engineers, particularly the over
time schedule. Rather than grant the schedule
asked by the union and recognize it as an or
t,-2uilzation we will, in cases where we cannot en
gage non-union engineers, tie up the boats.
A great many concerns will tie up their boats.
The Old Dominion Line, the Cornell rowing Com
pany, the Packer Dredging Company and almost
eve*7 individual owner will tie up 60 per ctht of
their boats. That will delay the malls and bring
about peneral distress.
We have also decided to engage counsel and pee
!f we cannot prosecute these marine engineers
under the- federal statute. Section 4.443. It Is In tho
Kevised Statutes, under the. heading. "Revocation
of Officers' Licenses lor Refusing to Serve." Un
der that we may proceed against the individual
engineer.
Preparations were made last night to lay up
most of the towboats not owned by the rail
roads, and the outfits of the wrecking com
panies. The Cornell company, which operates
about fifty boats, p;. : d off its men yesterday
and announced that it would lay up Its boats.
The Old Dominion company laid up some of its
tugs and lighters. An attempt will be made
by the companies to operate part of their fleets
with non-union men. Of the fleet of eight boats
owned by F. B. Dalzel! & Co.. three, the J. Fred
Lohman. the E. T. Dai/^-:i and the C. P. Ray
mood will be in commission. In the engine

RUSSIA IN TO STAY.
THE FEELING IX LONDON.
Only Force Can Turn Her Out of
Manch iiria — Personal Notes.
{Special to The New-York Tribune by Trench Cable.)
<C<»pyrisht: 1903: By The Tribune Association.)
London, May.l. 1 a. m.— The discussion In
Parliament yesterday afternoon failed to throw
any light on the Manchuria question. Lord
Lsnsdowne in the upper chamber and Lord Cran
borne in the lower house said the British Gov
ernment had received authoritative information
confirming; the news of Russia's: disclaimer, but
these official statements pave little satisfaction.
The impression is gaining: ground that nothing
short of *orce will turn Russia out of Man
churia. If England. America, and Japan exert
sufficient diplomatic pressure. Russia will with
draw her demands for the present, hut the com
plete Russifioation of Manchuria can only be a
question of time. The situation Is undoubtedly
gTave. Still, war is unlikely so far as England
is concerned. The Lion has not yet recovered
from the wounds which he received in South
Africa, and he naturally is anxious to avoid a
serious quarrel with th« Bear Just now.
It is reported from Brus^ls that besides the
$1*500.000 for the construction of a Palace of
Peace at The Hague, Mr. Carnegie has? given
$2001,000 for the organization of an international
library on diplomacy and international law. The
library will be attached to the Palace, which will
probably be built on the site on which the resi
dence of th* Grand Duke of Weimar is now
standing.
Following an idea originated by Sir Gilbert
Parker, there will be held in London in the
first week of July an allied colonial universities
dinner. anl on the previous day a conference
will be held when subjects of interest and im
portance to university life in all parts of the
King's dominions will be discussed.
Mr. Brodiick, who, as head of the War Office,
is responsible for the operations in Somaliland,
last night announced their practical abandon
ment at a presumably early date. It is now
known ti.it the War Office Is in possession of
confidential reports which make any campaign,
in that district, unless with very large forces, an
impossibility.
There is no improvement In the health of Car
dinal Vaughan, and it is very unlikely that he
•will be able again to resume active duty.

I4n Imposing Military and Civic Demonstration in Honor of the Louis
iana Purchase Exposition.
The buildings of the Louisiana Purchase. Exposition at St. Louis were dedicated yes
terday afternoon with ceremonies which, although marred hv disagreeable weath?r, were
impressive. The principal addresses were made hv President Roosevelt and ex- President
Cleveland. There was a long military and civic parade in the morning, with Adjutant
Genera] Corbin as grand marshal, and the exercises closed with a display of fireworks in
the evening. The city was crowded with visitors from all parts of the country.
PRESIDENT'S SPEECH.
Hoic the Policy of Expansion Has
Buili Up a Great Nation.
St. Louis. April 3O. — The dedicatory address
delivered by President Roosevelt follows:
Mr. President. Ladies and Gentlemen: At
ihe outset of my address let me recall to
the minds of my hearers that the ttuli upon
which we stand, before it was ours, was suc
cessively the possession of two mighty empires,
Spain and France, whose sons made a. deathless
record of heroism in the early annals of the New
World. No history of the Western country can
be written without paying heed to the wonderful
part played therein in the early da>s by the
soldiers, missionaries, explorers and traders.
who did their work for the honor of the proud
banners of Frame and Castile. While the set
tlers of English speaking stock and those of
Dutch, German and Scandinavian origin who
wen- associated with them were still clinging
close to the Eastern seaboard, the pioneers of
Spain and of France had penetrated deep into
the hitherto unknown wilderness of the West,
and had wandered far and wide within the boun
daries of what is now our mighty country. The
very cities themselves— St. Louis, Xew-Orleans.
Santa Fe— bear witness by their titles to
the nationalties of their founders. It was
not until the Revolution had begun that the
English speaking settlers pushed west across
the Alleghanie.s and not until a century ago
that they entered In to possess the land upon
which we now stand.
We have met here to-day to commemorate the
hundredth anni' ersary of the event which more
than any ether, after the foundation of the gov
ernment and always excepting its preserva
tion, determined 'he character of our national
life — determined that we should he a great ex
panding nation instead of relatively ■ small and
Stationary one.
THE BEGINNINGS OF EXPANSION.
Of course it was not with the Louisiana Pur
chase that our career of expansion began. In
the middle of the Revolutionary War the Illi
nois reg-ion. including the present States of Illi
nois and Indiana, was added to our domain by
force of arms, a? a sequel to the adventurous
expedition of (Jeorpe Rogers Clarke and his fron
tier riflemen. Later the treaties of Jay and
Plnrkney materially extended our real boun
daries to the west. Hut none of these events
was of fo striking a character as to fix the
popular imagination. Th^ old thirteen colonies
had always claimed that their rights stretched
westward to the Mississippi, and vague and un
real though these claims were until made good
by conquest, settlement and diplomacy, they
still served to give the impression that the ear
liest westward movements of our people were
little more than the filling !n of already existing
national boundaries.
run ther.- could be no illusion about the
acquisition of the vast territory beyond the Mis
sissippi, stretching westward to the Pa.-itic.
which in that day wis known as Louisiana.
This immense region was admittedly the terri
tory of a foreign power, of a European king
dom None of our people had ever laid claim
to a foot of it. lis acquisition could in DO sense
be treated as rounding out any existing claims.
When we acquired it we made evident once for
all that consciously and of set purpose we had
embarked on a career of expansion, that we ha i
taken our place among those daring and hardy
nations who risk much, with the. hope and de
*:re of winning high position among the great
power* of the earth. As is so often the case in

DEDICATION A SUCCESS.
The Parade and the Exercises in the
Liberal Arts Building.
fI?Y TEIKOHAI-H TO TTIF TRIBTWE. 1
St. Louis, April 3«>. — Starting -with a glittering
and imposing military display, followed by im
pressive dedicatory exercises and eloping with a
display of fireworks, the first of the three days
of the dedication ceremonies of the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition was a great success. The
weather was raw and cold, the buildings were in
a crude and unfinished condition, and the trans
portation facilities were inadequate, but despite
all this it was a day of enthusiasm and display.
There were possibly not more than twenty
thousand strangers in the city, aside from the
official representatives of the United States and
various State and foreign governments, and the
troops. President Roosevelt, ex-President
Cleveland, Cardinal Gibbons, Bishop Potter and
the governors of a score of States took, part
in the ceremonies.
There were about fifteen thousand troops !n
the line of parade. Adjutant General Corbin.
an imposing military figure, created a great deal
of interest as grand marshal. The troops were
the pick of the regulars and the State militia.
Governor Odell rode at the head of the New-
York troops. It was remarked everywhere that
New- York had the finest body of State troops in
the parade, and there was cheering from start
to finish for Governor <><i<Hl and his splendid
escort.
The police arrangements were inadequate.
President Roosevelt, on arriving at the review
ing stand, literally had to fight his way through
the crowd to the reviewing box. All through
the ceremony he was Jostled and crowded by
an eager mob. which seemed to be unrestricted.
After the parade he and his little handful of an
escort had to push their way through the crowd
to the Liberal Arts Building, where the dedi
catory ceremonies were held. In that building
no pathway had been cleared for him. and he
pushed, crowded and elbowed his way 'to the
platform. Many people commented on this and
wondered why the President of the United
States was subjected to danger and annoyance.
The ceremonies in the big Libeial Arts Build
ing were Impressive. David R. Francis intro
duced Thomas H. Carter as president of the
day. and the invocation was delivered by Car
dinal Gibbons, who, In his rich robes and red
cap, made a striking picture. Before the cere
monies began he chatted genially with Bishop
Potter, while President Roosevelt and ex-Presi
dent Cleveland carried on an animated conversa
tion. When President Roosevelt was intro
duced he was greeted by a roof-lifting cheer
from the throats of the eighteen thousand per
sons gathered in the enormous hall. So large
was the building and so great the crowd that
only a few could hear him. while in the far
background many could hardly see him. Re
alizing this, the President, instead of standing
on the regular platform, sprang nimbly on
the desk where the gavel rested. From this
elevation he began his speech amid uproarious
approval of this attempt to give every one a
chance to see him. He closed amid thunders
of applause, which was more a personal compli
ment than approval of his speech, for the noise
and disorder were so great that less than one
third of those in the hall distinctly heard a
word he said. Ex-President Cleveland was en
thusiastically welcomed and cheered to the echo
as he concluded. Bishop Potter pronounced the
benediction. ■ \
The fireworks display to-night was gorgeous,
and fully thirty thousand people witnessed it.

EX-PRESTDENT CKOVEK CLEVE
(Copyright: 1908: By Rrwrkwocxl.)
DOCKS DEVERT'S THEME.
XOXE LEFT FOR IXTH.
Says Candidate Will Make Tam
many "Tickle 1U Whiskers."
William S. Devery paid his respects to Charles
F. Murphy, leader of Tammany Hall, and Mr.
Murphy's associates in characteristic fashion
at a meeting attended by his election district
captains last night at Eighth-aye. and Twenty
third-st. He charged Murphy with parcelling
out th" city piers among his friends, so that
when the people of the IXth District had use
for a pier none was to be had.
The "Chief" said that the Tammany leaders
had sent him word that they v/ould concede
that he had made a formal demand for recog
nition as executive member from the IXth. and
this. Mr. Devery paid, made It unnecessary for
him personally to lead his band of IXth District
Spartans to the Wigwam to-night.
"We might as well be gentlemanly about It."'
said Devery. "Inasmuch as they admit that I
have made my demand, as the court's decision
indicated I should, I won't try to go over there
to-morrow night to disturb their little organi
zation."
Devery"B phalanx. 214 strong, will be there,
however, and will make a demand when the roll
is called for recognition for Devery as leader si
the IXth. It is the intention of the Murphy
men to ignore the IXth District in the calling of
the roll. Dr. W. J. Stewart, Peter J. Garvey.
George W. Gibbons. Wallace B. Hunter and
Frank Sullivan were appointed a committee to
tak» charge of the delegation at the Wigwam
to-night and see that when the roll is called a
demand is made for the recognition of Devery.
"I went to Commissioner Hawkes down at the
Dock Department the other day," said Devery.
"to see if I could get a pier or bulkhead for the
use of the people of this district. I met a gentle
rran— Murphy— at the Dock Department and
he told me that he would like to give me the use
of the pier, but it was not in his power to do so.
I learned on further inquiry that the reason
why I couldn't get a pier or bulkhead was be
cause 'Charlie' Murphy had given the one be
tween Twenty-eighth and Twenty-ninth sts. to
his friend Eagan, whoever Eagan Is. That's
why the people of this district will not have a
i dock there this summer. Murphy's got it. and
no wonder we won't get it. Gaffney & Co. and
Mr. Murphy are grabbing everything along the
docks. Xaughton & Co. and Mr. McMahon and
Mr Murphy are grabbing everything In the way
! of asphalt contaacts, and Plunkltt & Co.
are grabbing everything that's left. Little
•Dannie* McMahon and 'Charlie.' Murphy
and his friend with the split name. Mr.
Cram, are grabbing everything that's not
nailed down. I see by the papers that
Murphy and old man McLaughlln have fixed
things up bo that Manhattan will take the
Mayor and Brooklyn will take the Controller.
This reminds me of the old game of Forty-five,
where you robbed the king and robbed the ace.
But these gentlemen forget that the five fingers
is the best trump in the deck. Those five fingers
(stretching out his own) will take hold of the
backs of the recks of those gentlemen and wipe
them in the dust. I don't believe it is advisable.
as the gentleman suggested, to go into every
Assembly district and hold indignation meetings
to stir the people up. The newspapers will take
care of that. By the middle of summer the
papers will have a candidate in the field against
Tammany Hall that will make many's the
gentleman over there tickle their whisker*."
Frank Sullivan said that when the voters
registered their wills at the primaries no party
boss should be able to override their rights.
George W. Gibbons said that he knew that the
Devery men would be thrown out. ,
"If the Democratic party is going to lose
next fall let the responsibility fall where it :
belongs." said Gibbons.
John B McGoldrick mM: Ther» I* a gen
tleman three thousand miles from here who has
cot into the habit of thinking of our- people
about as some of his neighbors"* ancestors
thought of our people l.;<> years ago. Only he
eoes them one better. He not only believes in
taxation without representation but he believes
In government without representation." Wai- {
lace B. Hunter and Joseph Neuman also spoke.
