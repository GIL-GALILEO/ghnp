	"essay": "Founded in 1901, the <i>Vidalia Advance</i> was a Democratic, eight page, publication delivered every Tuesday. The first editors, J. H. Breedlove and J. A. Mobley, set the subscription cost at one dollar per year and reported on the weekly activities of the community. In 1915, A. B. Cargile, editor and publisher at the time, oversaw the <i>Advance</i> becoming Vidalia\'s sole newspaper with a circulation of over 800. The paper merged with the <i>Lyons Progress</i> in 1991 and was renamed the <i>Advance-Progress</i>. That same year, the publication became Toombs County\'s legal organ and the <i>Advance</i> continues to serve Toombs, Montgomery, and Lyons counties today."}
