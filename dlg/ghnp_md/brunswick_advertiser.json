	"essay": "The town of Brunswick was incorporated in 1836. The <i>Brunswick Advocate</i>, the city's first newspaper, began publication that same year, followed by the <i>Brunswick Herald</i> in 1856. The <i>Brunswick Advertiser</i> was established in 1875 as a weekly publication and merged with the <i>Brunswick Appeal</i> in 1881. The 1880s were a time of significant growth for the city during which time the population tripled and the newly merged <i>Advertiser and Appeal</i> served the growing city throughout the rest of the decade."
