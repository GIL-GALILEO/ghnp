  "essay": "In 1881, W. E. Harp founded the <i>Jackson News</i> as a weekly, Democratic competitor to the <i>Middle Georgia Argus</i>. At the time, the <i>Argus </i>published out of Indian Springs, Georgia, which left the <i>News</i> as the only newspaper based within the city of Jackson. W. E. Harp left the paper for two years beginning in 1890. In his absence, the paper was published by McDonald & Joiner with John G. McDonald as lead editor. In 1891, the <i>News</i> embraced its increasingly Populist leanings and changed its title to the <i>News and Alliance</i> to reflect the growth of the Farmerâ€™s Alliance in Georgia. W. E. Harp returned to the paper in 1892 and, besides adjusting the masthead to <i>News and Allianceman</i>, he maintained the direction of the paper until it ceased publication in 1895."
