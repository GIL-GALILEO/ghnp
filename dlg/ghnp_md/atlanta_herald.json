That same year, <a href=\"http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/henry-w-grady-1850-1889\">Henry W. Grady</a> became a partial owner of the paper and after Abrams left the paper in 1873, Grady became the editor. It was in the <i>Daily Herald</i> that Grady began his celebrated crusade for an industrialized \"New South.\" Despite the attention Grady received for his writings, the <i>Herald</i> was acquired and shut down by the <i>Atlanta Constitution</i> in February of 1876."
