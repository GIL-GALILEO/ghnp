Styles became publisher 1867 and changed the masthead to the Albany News. The paper merged with the upstart <em>Albany Advertiser</em> in 1880 to form the <em>Albany News and Advertiser</em>, which continued publication into the early 1890s.  In its final year of publication, the daily <em>News and Advertiser</em> cost four dollars yearly and the Saturday edition cost one dollar annually; the publishers self-reported a circulation of over 3,000 and identified the paper as Democratic."
