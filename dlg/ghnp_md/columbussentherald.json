  "essay": "The <i>Columbus Sentinel</i> was first published by William Cline and B. V. Iverson in the early 1830s. The paper merged with J. B. Webbâ€™s <i>Republican Herald</i> in 1838 to become the <i>Columbus Sentinel and Herald</i>. The weekly paper ran until February 1841, when James Van Ness founded the <i>Columbus Times</i> and put the <i>Sentinel and Herald</i> out of business."
