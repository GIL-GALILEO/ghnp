	"essay": "Beginning as the <i>Sandersville Herald & Georgian</i> in 1841, the publication's masthead would become the <i>Sandersville Herald</i> in 1872 and sold for 2 dollar subscriptions. The publishers of the <i>Herald</i> in 1873 were Medlock, Arline, and Rodgers but, by 1876, the owners and publishers were J. M. G Medlock and James D. Anthony. The paper favored the Democratic party and published on Thursdays until its absorption by the similarly Democratic <i>Sandersville Progress</i> in 1909."
