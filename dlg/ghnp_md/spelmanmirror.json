  "essay": "First published in October 1924, <i>The Campus Mirror</i> was a monthly newspaper managed and edited by the students of <a href='https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/education/spelman-college'>Spelman College</a>. The paper featured editorials, campus news, events, speeches, local advertisements, and photographs of classes and organizations. In addition to its news coverage, literary works by students and advice for interviews or studying could be found in the <i>Mirror's</i> pages. A special commencement issue was published at the end of each academic year. These issues included photographs and covered the graduating and incoming classes. The newspaper's final issue circulated in May 1950 after 26 years of covering campus life."
