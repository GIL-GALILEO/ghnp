  "essay": "E. J. Purse published the first issue of his literary magazine, <i>Friend of the Family,</i> on March 1, 1849. For two dollars a year, subscribers received the four-page paper on a weekly basis. Among the many contributors were Susan A. Stuart, C. L. Wheler, L. T. Voigt, A. B. Meek, and Annie Lee. William Tappan Thompson’s ‘Major Jones’ Letters’ and other works were also re-printed in <i>Friend of the Family.</i> The magazine was short-lived, however, with its last issue printed in March, 1851."
