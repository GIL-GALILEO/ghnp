In 1854, the paper began daily publication. The <i>Intelligencer</i> merged with the <i>Atlanta Examiner</i> in September 1857. In November of 1864, the forces of Union General William T. Sherman and his Union troops captured Atlanta and burned down substantial portions of the city. The destruction dealt a blow to the city's newspaper industry as the <i>Intelligencer</i> was the only Atlanta paper to survive the war. The success of the <i>Atlanta Constitution</i> in the post-war years, however, forced the <i>Atlanta Intelligencer</i> out of business in 1871."
