  "essay": "In April 1905, T. R. Whitley, L. C. Upshaw, and J. A. Pittman established the <i>Douglas County Sentinel</i> and began publishing the title in Douglasville the following month. The <i>Sentinel</i> had an auspicious beginning as an eight page weekly paper with immediate legal organ status. During its run, the paper changed its name only once when it was published for a month in 1922 as the <i>West Georgia Sentinel</i>, before reverting to its original name. The <i>Douglas County Sentinel</i> continues publication today and remains the largest paper in Douglas County."
