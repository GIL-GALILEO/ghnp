  "essay": "The <i>LaGrange Herald</i>, started by Dr. Bronson as a weekly publication in 1843, was the first newspaper established in LaGrange and one of the earliest in western Georgia. It was later renamed the <i>Chattahoochee</i> and by the mid-1850s the paper was again retitled the <i>LaGrange Reporter</i>. William J. Scott and Judge Alexander M. Speer were early editors. Thomas J. Bacon edited the paper until 1861 and was killed in 1862 during the Battle of Seven Pines. During the Civil War and in the years that followed, C. H. C. Willingham edited the paper. He was a staunch critic of the Federal occupation of the South after the war and was nearly arrested on several occasions for his criticisms. The masthead remained <i>LaGrange Reporter </i>until a 1928 merger in which, the <i>LaGrange Reporter, LaGrange Graphic</i>, and <i>LaGrange Shuttle</i> were all absorbed into the <i>LaGrange Daily News</i>, which continues publication in LaGrange to the present day."
