  "essay": "W. S. D. Wikle established Cedartown's first newspaper in 1869 by under the masthead <i>Cedartown Record</i>. The <i>Record</i> ran without competition until Thomas Gibson founded the <i>Cedartown Express</i>. The <i>Express</i> ended publication after Gibson left to become an elder for the Methodist Church. The <i>Cedartown Advertiser</i>, started by Dr. William Bradford, ran for a short time after the closing of the <i>Express</i> and eventually merged with the <i>Record</i>. A locally organized stock company established the Democratic <i>Cedartown Standard</i> in 1889 and absorbed the <i>Advertiser</i>. Shortly after its foundation, E. B. Russel and W. S. Coleman purchased the paper and operated the publication continuously from 1889 to 1912. In 1912, Russel purchased Coleman's interests and was sole proprietor of the paper until his death in June 1930. As a notable contributor, Charles K. Henderson, member of company F. 3rd Georgia in the Confederate Army, wrote and published a serial history of Polk County in the <i>Cedartown Standard</i>, starting in 1897. The <i>Standard</i> continued publication into the twentieth century and is the oldest continually published paper in the county. It combined with the <i>Rockmark Journal</i> in 2014 to form the <i>Polk Standard Journal</i> under the ownership of Times Journal Inc."
