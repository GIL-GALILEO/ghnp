  "essay": "M. J. Kappel published the first issue of the <i>Times</i> on June 18, 1823 in Savannah, Georgia. Kappel intended his paper to publish semi-weekly from November to May and weekly for the remaining months each year. The newspaper, at a subscription rate of three dollars, covered merchant news, local events, and featured literary selections. The <i>Times</i> could not compete with other contemporaneous papers in the city and ceased publishing in the mid-1820s."
