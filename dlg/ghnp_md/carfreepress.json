  "essay": "Edwin R. Sharpe founded two of Carrollton’s earliest newspapers. In 1872, he established the <i>Carroll County Times</i> but quickly sold the paper and took up farming for over a decade. He founded a second newspaper in 1883 titled the <i>Carroll Free Press</i>. Sharpe continued publication of the paper until his death in 1899. The <i>County Times</i> and <i>Free Press</i> were brought under combined ownership in 1943 and eventually merged into the <i>Times-Free Press</i> in 1948. In 1980, the <i>Times-Free Press</i> merged with the <i>Carroll County Georgian</i> to form the city’s current paper, the <i>Times-Georgian</i>."
