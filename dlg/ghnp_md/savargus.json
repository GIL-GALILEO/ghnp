Bartlett supported the newly formed Union party and published opposition to Troup party members alongside state and local news. Like its daily counterpart, the <i>Savannah Mercury</i>, the <i>Argus</i> ceased printing in 1829 when Bartlett moved to Columbus, Georgia, to establish another Union newspaper, the <i>Democrat</i>."
