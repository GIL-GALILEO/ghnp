  "essay": "L. F. W. Andrews founded the <i>Georgia Citizen</i> on March 21, 1850, in Macon, Georgia. The paper was Whig in politics, leaned strongly pro-Union, and published weekly. Andrews acted as publisher and editor of the newspaper, but was briefly driven from Macon in July 1850 after he was accused of being an abolitionist. In the first year of its publication, the paper achieved a circulation of 1,000 which placed it behind the <i>Georgia Telegraph</i> and <i>Georgia Journal and Messenger</i> in popularity. Andrews expanded the paper with a daily edition in 1857. This daily edition, titled the <i>Daily Citizen</i>, only lasted a year but was revived in 1859 under the masthead <i>Daily Georgia Citizen.</i> Ever ambitious, Andrews also attempted to print a semi-weekly edition of the <i>Citizen</i> in 1859, but this venture did not last a year. Andrews published weekly and daily editions of his paper from 1859 until ceasing circulation of all editions in 1861."
