  "essay": "Malcolm Stafford founded Harmony Grove’s first newspaper in 1875 as the <i>Northeast Georgia Progress</i>. The paper’s title became the <i>Northeastern Progress</i> in 1878. Stafford only worked on the paper independently for a year; in 1876, Stafford brought on W. A. Shackelford as printer who stayed until 1881 when he became owner of the <i>Oglethorpe Echo</i>. Under the banner “[to] Serve God and the People, and make an Honest Living,” the four-page Democratic <i>Northeastern Progress</i> was delivered every Wednesday for those who paid its $1.50 per annum fee. The paper ceased printing in 1881."
