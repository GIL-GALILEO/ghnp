	"essay": "James P. Hambleton established the <i>Southern Confederacy</i> in 1859. At the outbreak of the Civil War, Hambleton joined the Confederate Army and sold the paper in 1861 to C. R. Hanleiter and G. W. Adair, who were the owners of the <i>Gate-City Guardian</i>. The new owners merged their paper with <i>Southern Confederacy</i> and took the title of their new acquisition. The strongly Democratic paper continued publication in Atlanta until 1864, when the publication moved to Macon. In 1865, the <i>Southern Confederacy</i> ceased publication."
