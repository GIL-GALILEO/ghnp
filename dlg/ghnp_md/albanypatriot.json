Boughton founded the <em>Albany Patriot</em> in 1845 and within two years, the paper's circulation exceeded 1,000. Tift immediately aligned the <em>Patriot</em> with the politics of the Democratic Party, placing it in direct competition with the Whig-aligned <em>Albany Courier</em>. The paper's politics remained consistent when, in 1860, the <em>Patriot</em> supported secession from the Union. Although the paper regularly delivered wartime news to the citizens of <a href=\"https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/counties-cities-neighborhoods/albany\">Albany</a>, the owners of the <em>Patriot</em> suspended its publication between 1862 and 1864 due to the strains of the war, and ceased publication altogether in 1866."
