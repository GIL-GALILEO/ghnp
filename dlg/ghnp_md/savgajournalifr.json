  "essay": "Prior to James Carey’s founding of the <i>Georgia Journal and Independent Federal Register</i>, the only newspaper published in Savannah was James Johnston’s <i>Georgia Gazette</i>. On December 4, 1793, Carey published the first issue of the <i>Georgia Journal and Independent Federal Register</i> and advertised his newspaper as a semi-weekly published every Wednesday and Saturday. Unable to build a large enough subscriber-base to support a semi-weekly, the newspaper ceased publication on February 19, 1794."
