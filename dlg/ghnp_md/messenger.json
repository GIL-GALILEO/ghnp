  "essay": "Beginning on March 16, 1823, Simri Rose and Matthew Robinson published the <i>Messenger</i> out of Fort Hawkins, Georgia. When Macon was incorporated as a town on December 10, 1823, the partners moved their paper to Macon. In 1824, Rose and Robinson changed their paperâ€™s masthead to the <i>Georgia Messenger</i>. The <i>Georgia Messenger</i>, incorporated under S. Rose and Company, merged with the <i>Georgia Journal</i> in 1847 to become the <i>Georgia Journal and Messenger</i>. By 1850, the <i>Journal and Messenger</i> identified itself as Whig and achieved a circulation of 3,200. The paper eventually merged with the <i>Georgia Weekly Telegraph</i> in 1869 after the J. W. Burke Company sold out to <i>Telegraph</i> owner Joseph Clisby."
