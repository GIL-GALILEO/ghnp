The paper’s publishers, Daniel Starnes and Co., wrote to their subscribers a promise that the paper would provide civil, religious, and literary reading and ended their testimonial with the quote, <q>no party but my country, no friend but truth.</q> The paper sought to establish itself as a truthful and moral source of information in the already crowded field of Augusta publications."
