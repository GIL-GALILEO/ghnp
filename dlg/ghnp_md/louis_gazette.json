James Hely partnered with Day in 1800 and they changed the publication's name to the <i>Louisville Gazette and Republican Trumpet</i>. The paper supported the politics of Jeffersonian Democracy in the early nineteenth century. The publication's title reverted to the <i>Louisville Gazette</i> in 1810 and the paper ceased publication the following year."
