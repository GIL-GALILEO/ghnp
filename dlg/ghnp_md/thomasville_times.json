	"essay": "Civil War veteran John Triplett established the <i>Thomasville Times</i> with partner John R. Christian as a Democratic weekly newspaper in 1873. After a year of publication, Triplett bought out Christian's share and ran the <i>Times</i> under his sole ownership. The popularity of the paper led to its expansion into a daily edition in 1888. The following year, Triplett purchased the competing <i>Southern Enterprise</i> and combined the two papers under the <i>Daily Times-Enterprise</i> title. He remained as editor of the paper for thirty years, before selling the publication in early 1903. E. R. Jerger took over ownership in 1907 and continued his involvement with the paper until his death in 1960. Lee E. Kelly, Sr., whose work with the publication began as a paperboy in the early twentieth century, took over controlling ownership of the <i>Times-Enterprise</i> in the 1950s and eventually passed ownership on to his sons. The paper was eventually sold to Community Newspaper Holdings."
