  "essay": "A.P. Burr, A. G. Murray’s assistant editor at the <i>American Union</i>, left to establish his own paper, <i>Independent South, </i>in 1858. The publication aligned itself as a State’s Rights paper and reported the activities of pro-secessionists. In the July 21, 1859 issue of the paper, Senator Alfred Iverson’s famous two-hour secession speech was reported word for word. The <i>Independent South</i> continued to publish until 1861 when Burr left to join the Confederate army."
