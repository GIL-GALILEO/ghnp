  "essay": "Although incorporated in 1809, the city of Madison would not have its own weekly literary newspaper until 1842. Colonel Cornelius R. Hanleiter published the first issue of the literary-focused <i>Southern Miscellany</i> on April 5, 1842, and printed in Madison until 1846. In 1843, Hanleiter hired <i>Augusta Mirror</i> editor and famed humorist William Tappan Thompson to edit the paper. Many of Thompson’s popular ‘Major Jones’ Letters’ appeared in the <i>Miscellany. </i>Thompson edited the <i>Southern Miscellany</i> until 1845 when he moved to Baltimore to work on another periodical. Augusta Baldwin Longstreet, E. M. Pendleton, Henry Rootes Jackson, D. A. Chittenden, and W. H. Campbell were all contributors during the paper’s time in Madison. In 1847, the paper moved to Atlanta and became the <i>Southern Miscellany, and the upper Georgia Whig</i>. The paper ceased printing in 1849 with the winding down of Whig politics."
