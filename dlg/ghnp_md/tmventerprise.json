  "essay": "Fulton and L. C. Bryan published the first issue of the <i>Southern Enterprise</i> in Thomasville on June 12, 1855. The paper was strongly aligned with the American, or Know-Nothing, Party and considered its rival the Democratic <i>Wire-Grass Reporter</i>. Bryan was soon the sole editor of the <i>Southern Enterprise</i> as political differences caused Fulton to leave. The <i>Enterprise</i> supported Know-Nothing candidate Garnett Andrews for Governor in 1855, and frequently editorialized against the removal of Georgia’s capitol from Milledgeville to Atlanta. In April, 1858, the paper expanded its coverage to Troupville with the editorial assistance of W. B. Bennett. The paper was only published in dual locations for a few months, discontinuing the arrangement on July 24. Major William Kline became Bryan’s assistant editor in Bennett’s stead and the paper continued publication until May 8, 1861, when early stages of the Civil War became a disruption. In the 1890s, the <i>Southern Enterprise</i> was combined with the <i>Thomasville Times</i> to form the <i>Times-Enterprise</i>."
