  "essay": "Based on publisher reporting and volume numbering, <i>The Butts County Progress</i> traces its origins to the <i>Jackson News</i>, which was founded by W. E. Harp in 1882. In the mid-1890s, the <i>News </i>ceased publication but reemerged as the <i>Jackson Record. </i>The <i>Record </i>became the <i>Butts County Progress</i> in 1907 with Van Wilhite as sole editor and publisher. Wilhite listed the <i>Progress</i> as an independent local paper, and the paper remained that way until J. D. Jones aligned the paper with the Democratic Party in 1910. For five years the <i>Progress</i> was a fierce competitor to the <i>Jackson Argus</i>, and this competition can be found in year-to-year circulation reports. In 1910, the <i>Progress</i> submitted a circulation report of 769 compared to the <i>Argus</i>’ publisher’s report of 750. Each successive year until J.D. Jones purchased the <i>Jackson Argus</i> on July 2, 1915, one could expect the two papers to outpace each other with larger circulation reports. In their final year as independent publications, the <i>Progress</i> reported 1,500 subscribers compared to the <i>Argus</i>’ 1,350. The newspaper continues today as the <i>Jackson Progress-Argus</i> and Jackson, Georgia’s legal organ."
