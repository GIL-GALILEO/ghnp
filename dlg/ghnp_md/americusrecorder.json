  "essay": "The <em>Americus Recorder</em> began as a tri-weekly publication in 1879 under the ownership of Merrel Callaway and served as a strong competitor to the <em>Sumter Republican</em>. Callaway, who sold his interest in the <em>Recorder</em> a few years earlier, joined a group to establish the <em>Americus Times</em> in 1890. The city couldnâ€™t support both the <em>Recorder</em> and the <em>Times</em> and the publications ceased production in February 1891. Captain Bascom Myrick merged the two titles under the <em>Times-Recorder</em> moniker and resumed circulation in April of the same year. Myrick ran the paper until his death in 1895, at which time his wife, Marie Louise Scudder Myrick, took over as the owner and editor for the next twelve years. During that period, she was the only woman in the state to hold such a position. In 1907, Thomas Gamble, who would later serve as mayor of Savannah, purchased the paper and served as its editor for five years. The paper continued its success throughout the twentieth century, despite constant competition, and continues to serve the citizens of <a href="https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/counties-cities-neighborhoods/americus">Americus</a>."
