	"essay": "E. H. Grouby moved to Blakely, Georgia from Abbeville, Alabama in 1859 and established the <i>Early County News</i> that same year. The town\'s lack of railroad did not hinder Grouby who had the original presses delivered by boat via the Chattahoochee River and then ox-drawn for the final stretch for the trip. Grouby acted as sole editor, proprietor, and publisher until 1872 when he sold the paper to the Fleming family. While a Confederate supporter, Grouby was vocal in his opposition to the 1864 conscription of individuals who paid for substitutes despite being against the use of substitutes in the first place. With a circulation of 700 in 1872, the Democratic paper served as the paper of record for Early, Clay, Calhoun, and Miller counties.The <i>Early County News</i> proved resilient in 1907 when the original office building on the north side of court square burned down and an issue was still published that week. The title has published continuously for ninety years and continues to serve its community today."}
