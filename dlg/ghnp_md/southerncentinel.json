  "essay": "The earliest 1793 issues of the <em>Southern Centinel, and Gazette of the State’s</em> were circulated under the masthead <em>Southern Centinel, and Universal Gazette</em>, but changed to its permanent title later that year. The paper was printed in Augusta, and for a subscription cost of four dollars per year, one could receive the <em>Southern Centinel, and Gazette of the State</em> on a weekly basis until the paper ceased publication in the early 19th century. Directly below the masthead, the owner and editor’s name, Alexander M’Millan is listed with the title <q>Printer to the State.</q>"
