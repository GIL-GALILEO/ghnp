  "essay": "Following Daniel Sweat’s closure of the <i>Reporter</i> in Waycross in the early 1890s, Ben E. Russell established the weekly <i>Waycross Herald</i> to fill the city’s news vacuum. Subsequent owner A. P. Perham began publishing the paper on a daily basis under the <i>Evening Herald</i> banner, making it the city's first daily newspaper. A competing publication, the <i>Waycross Journal</i>, began weekly circulation in October of 1895 under editor Daniel Sweat, formerly of the <i>Reporter</i>. The <i>Journal</i> transitioned into daily circulation in 1911. The <i>Waycross Herald</i> and <i>Waycross Journal</i> eventually merged into a single publication in 1914 and was renamed the <i>Waycross Journal-Herald</i>. The paper continues publication today under that name."
