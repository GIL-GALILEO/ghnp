	"essay": "Milledgeville's <i>Union and Recorder</i> was created by a merger between the <i>Federal Union</i> and <i>Southern Recorder</i> in 1872. Following the merger, the Democratic paper was delivered every Wednesday and could be purchased at two dollars per year; the editor was S. N. Boughton and the publishers were Boughton, and Barnes & Moore. Eventually, the paper adopted its contemporary name, the <i>Union Recorder</i>, in 1886. The <i>Union Recorder</i> continued to prosper during the remainder of the twentieth century, and today serves as the primary news organ for the city of Milledgeville. Under the ownership of Community Newspaper Holdings, the award-winning paper publishes issues five days a week with a circulation of over 7,000."
