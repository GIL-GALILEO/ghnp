  "essay": "Attorneys J. S. Bigby and J. C. Wootten established the <i>Newnan Herald</i> in September 1865, making it the first newspaper founded and published in Georgia after the end of the Civil War. The <i>Herald</i> merged with a local competitor, the <i>Coweta Advertiser</i>, and became the <i>Herald and Advertiser</i> in 1887. James E. Brown took over as editor of the paper after the merger. In 1915, the publication absorbed the <i>Newnan News</i> and reverted to its original name, the <i>Newnan Herald</i>. In 1947, the <i>Herald</i> moved into the same plant with another competitor, the <i>Newnan Times</i> (established in 1936) and the two papers merged by the end of the year to become the <i>Times-Herald</i>. Under that title, the paper served Newnan through the twentieth century before owners renamed it the Newnan Times-Herald. The paper continues publication as the paper of record in Coweta County."
