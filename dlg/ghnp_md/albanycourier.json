  "essay": "The <i>Albany Courier</i> was a weekly Whig-aligned newspaper founded in 1841. By 1847, the paper was published by Gardner, Brother & Harvey. On the topic of the Mexican-American war, the <i>Courier</i> was among the earliest Whig papers in Georgia to criticize the war outright. Nelson Tift’s Democratic <i>Albany Patriot</i> was the <i>Courier’s</i> commercial competitor during the 1840s. As with many Whig newspapers of the era, the <i>Courier</i> ceased publication sometime in the late 1840s."
