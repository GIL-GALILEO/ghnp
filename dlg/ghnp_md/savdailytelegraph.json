  "essay": "C. Macardell first published the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> on January 15, 1840. Macardell, a Democrat, ran ads in support of Martin Van Buren and John Forsyth for president and vice president respectively. True to its masthead, the paper was a daily publication striving to cover local, national, and foreign news. The newspaper was unable to sustain itself and ceased publication the same year as its founding."
