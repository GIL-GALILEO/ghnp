  "essay": "The <i>Southern Literary Companion</i> was a literary magazine established by I. N. Davis in Newnan in January, 1860. The publication primarily featured essays, poems, and short stories, but also reported some local news and the events of the Civil War. J. C. Wooten served as editor and W. N. Meigs acted as publisher in the early 1960s. In 1864, ownership of the publication fell under Stephens and Company, with J. V. D. Stephens and J. S. Bigby as editors. Notably, one of the longest serving editors was former <i>Madison Visitor</i> editor, Miss C. W. Barber. Barber edited the “Ladies Department” for most of the <i>Southern Literary Companion’s</i> brief existence; many of the literary works featured were Barber’s writing. In 1864, the <i>Companion</i> reduced in size to a single folio sheet with seven columns to a page. The newspaper ceased publication in 1865, but Barber would go on to establish the <i>Miss Barber’s Weekly</i> in Newnan."
