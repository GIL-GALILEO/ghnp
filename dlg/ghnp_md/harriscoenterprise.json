  "essay": "The first issue of the <i>Harris County Enterprise</i> began publication on May 17, 1860 in Hamilton, Georgia. James H. Moore served as the newspaper’s editor for its short lifespan. The <i>Enterprise</i> was able to continue publication during the Civil War, but due to difficulty acquiring paper at that time, the newspaper was published at a reduced size. Under Moorefield’s ownership, the <i>Enterprise</i> came out every Thursday at a subscription cost of two dollars a year. In the early 1860s, Moorefield sold the paper to L. W. Williams who took the subscription list and title with him to West Point, Georgia. Murphy and Thomas revived the <i>Enterprise</i> in Harris County on March 4, 1864."
