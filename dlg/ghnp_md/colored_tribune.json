	"essay": "<p>John H. Deveaux founded the <i>Colored Tribune</i> in 1875 in Savannah to serve the city's African American community. He renamed the paper the <i>Savannah Tribune</i> the following year. White printers in the city, however, refused to continue printing the paper thus forcing its closure in 1878. Deveaux would reopen the Tribune in 1886 and oriented it as a Republican paper. He continued as editor for several years before passing it to Solomon “Sol” C. Johnson. The paper gave voice to issues of racial injustice, segregation, and other matters relevant to the people of Savannah during Reconstruction. The Tribune remained in print until 1960. Banker Robert E. James resumed publication of the paper in 1973 and the Tribune remained in print ever since.</p>"
