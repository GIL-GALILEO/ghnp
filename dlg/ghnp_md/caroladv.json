  "essay": "Asbury, Wootten, and Company founded the <i>Carrollton Advocate </i>as a weekly newspaper in April, 1860. The <i>Advocate</i> was a pro-secession, Democratic, newspaper during its run and published an editorial in November, 1860, predicting the secession of South Carolina. Following Georgia’s Secession Ordinance in 1861, the paper praised Georgia’s legislature. Following Wootten’s departure in 1861, the company reorganized as Anderson, Asbury, and Company. The paper’s masthead was shortened to the <i>Advocate</i> during the ownership change in 1861 and remained unaltered until its cessation that same year."
