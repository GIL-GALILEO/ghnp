  "essay": "James M. Smythe founded the <em>Tri-weekly Republic</em> in Augusta in 1848. With Smythe as owner and editor, Robert A. Wayne assisted as a co-editor of the newspaper. The paper, which reflected Smytheâ€™s Whig politics, could be purchased in advance for a subscription cost of four dollars. The <em>Tri-weekly Republic</em> merged with the <em>Daily Constitution</em> in 1851 to form the <em>Daily Constitutionalist and Republic</em>."
