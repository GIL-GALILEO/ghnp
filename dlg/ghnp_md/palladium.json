  "essay": "Newnan’s earliest newspaper was Samuel Minor’s <i>Coweta Advertiser</i> in 1835. This publication, however, was short-lived. J. Nelson founded a replacement newspaper, whose title is unknown, later that same year. Nelson, in turn, sold his paper to Charles F. Sherborn, who produced the city’s first stable newspaper, the <i>Palladium</i>. The <i>Palladium</i> was circulated weekly until 1837 when Sherborn ceased publication."
