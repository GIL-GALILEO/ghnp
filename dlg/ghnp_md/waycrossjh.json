  "essay": "Following Daniel Sweat’s closure of the <em>Reporter</em> in Waycross in the early 1890s, Ben E. Russell established the weekly <em>Waycross Herald</em> to fill the city’s news vacuum. Subsequent owner A. P. Perham began publishing the paper on a daily basis under the <em>Evening Herald</em> banner, making it the city's first daily newspaper. A competing publication, the <em>Waycross Journal</em>, began weekly circulation in October of 1895 under editor Daniel Sweat, formerly of the <em>Reporter</em>. The <em>Journal</em> transitioned into daily circulation in 1911. The <em>Waycross Herald</em> and <em>Waycross Journal</em> eventually merged into a single publication in 1914 and was renamed the <em>Waycross Journal-Herald</em>. The paper continues publication today under that name."
