	"essay": "The <i>Augusta Constitutionalist</i>, founded by Phillip C. Gieu, began as a tri-weekly paper in 1822 titled the <i>Georgia Constitutionalist</i>. Despite evidence to the contrary, in 1873, the paper claimed to be the \"oldest democratic paper in the south\" with its founding date set at 1799; the <a href=\"http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/augusta-chronicle\"><i>Augusta Chronicle</i></a>, founded in 1785 and long rival of the <i>Constitutionalist</i>, disputed this statement. James Gardner, the <i>Constitutionalist</i>'s longest running owner and editor, purchased the paper in June of 1845. Gardner identified himself as a southern rights Democrat but notably used his paper to support union-Democrat <a href=\"http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/government-politics/howell-cobb-1815-1868\">Howell Cobb</a> in 1853 for U.S Senate. Gardner published many editorials voicing opinion against Joseph E. Brown's run for a third gubernatorial term in 1861 as well as warning against southern resistance in the case of a Republican presidential victory. Despite these misgivings about secession, the <i>Constitutionalist</i> would throw its support behind the Confederacy. Having moved to a more owner-oriented role, Gardner briefly hired Henry W. Cleveland as editor in 1864. Cleveland, however, was fired for his private communication with and open support for reunification advocates <a href=\"http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/government-politics/joseph-e-brown-1821-1894\">Joseph E. Brown</a> and <a href=\"http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/government-politics/alexander-stephens-1812-1883\">Alexander Stephens</a>. Cleveland's replacement, James Ryder Randall, revamped the <i>Constitutionalist</i>'s opposition to reunion and this position resulted in the paper's suspension by the Union military from May 7th to May 17th, 1865. Gardner maintained a degree of ownership until retirement in May of 1873 and presses shut down briefly under increasing financial struggle. James Randall, with the help of investors, revived the <i>Constitutionalist</i>. The paper survived independently until March, 1877 when Patrick Walsh of the <i>Chronicle and Sentinel</i> purchased the publication to create the <i>Chronicle and Constitutionalist</i>."
