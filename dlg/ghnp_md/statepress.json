  "essay": "E. C. and A. M. Rowland first published the daily edition of the <i>State Press</i> in 1859. The paper was Democratic, pro-secession, and staunchly opposed to abolition. In the June 23, 1859 issue, the editors featured several samples from northern newspapers in an effort to show abolitionist bias coming from the North. The publication ceased printing the same year as its founding."
