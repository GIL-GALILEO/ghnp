  "essay": "William H. Royal published the inaugural issue of the <i>Georgia Clipper</i> on March 8, 1860, in Warrenton, Georgia. This predecessor to the <i>Warrenton Clipper</i> featured local news and advertisements along with some national reporting from other publications. Although few 1860 issues of the <i>Clipper</i> exist, the publication published issues into the 1870s. The paper became the <i>Warrenton Clipper</i> in 1875 under H. W. J. Ham and continues today as Warrentonâ€™s legal organ."
