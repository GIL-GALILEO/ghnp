  "essay": "William M. Jefferson founded the <i>Weekly Gazette</i> as a Democratic weekly newspaper in 1857. The paper’s masthead became the <i>Greensboro Weekly Gazette</i> later that year and remained as such until returning to the <i>Weekly Gazette</i> moniker in 1859. In 1860, the publication became the <i>Planter’s Weekly</i> with F. C. Fuller as its editor. Fuller continued to publish until 1861 when the paper proved financially unsustainable."
