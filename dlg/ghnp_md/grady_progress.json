	"essay": "Grady County was established out of sections of Decatur and Thomas counties in 1905. D.L. Williams began editing and publishing the Democratic-leaning <i>Grady County Progress</i> just five years later in Cairo in July 1910. The <i>Progress</i> attempted to replace its competitor, the <i>Cairo Messenger</i>, as the county's official newspaper in August of that same year, but was unsuccessful in its effort. The newspaper did achieve a circulation of over 1,000, about half the population of Cairo at the time, but eventually ceased publication in the early 20th century."
