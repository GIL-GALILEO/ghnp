  "essay": "J. B. Cubbedge founded the <i>Savannah Journal</i> in 1851 as a daily newspaper. At times, the masthead was printed as the <i>Morning and Evening Journal.</i> On August 11, 1852, Cubbedge settled on the title <i>Savannah Evening Journal</i>, but this title was maintained for less than a year when Cubbedge merged his newspaper with the <i>Savannah Courier</i> to form the <i>Savannah Daily Journal and Courier.</i>"
