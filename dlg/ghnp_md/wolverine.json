  "essay": "Originally called the <i>Tattler</i>, the <i>Wolverine Observer</i> was a student-run publication serving <a href='https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/education/morris-brown-college'>Morris Brown College</a> and its community. The paper became the <i>Wolverine Observer</i> in 1935 and initially published monthly under the direction of Professor V. C. Clinch. This monthly publishing goal found itself limited, however, and often the paper only published a few times during active school sessions. By the 1960s, the <i>Observer</i> was a member of the Intercollegiate Press (later the Associated Collegiate Press) and was largely run by the students themselves. The <i>Observer</i> sought to report news of interest to the Morris Brown College community and featured student editorials throughout its pages. Publication of the paper ceased during the 2000-2001 school year."
