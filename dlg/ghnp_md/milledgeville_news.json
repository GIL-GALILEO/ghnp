At its peak, the <i>News</i> matched the <i>Recorder</i>'s circulation of about 1,200. One could purchase a subscription to the <i>Democratic News</i> for one dollar per anuum and, in the beginning; the paper delivery could be expected every Saturday morning. In 1909, Vaughn sold his paper to city councilman H. E. McAuliffe, a former editor of the <i>Atlanta Journal</i>. The <i>News</i> would remain under McAuliffe's editorship until the paper ceased publication in the early 1920s."
