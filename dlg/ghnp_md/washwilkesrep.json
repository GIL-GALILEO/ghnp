  "essay": "William Henry Wilson founded the <i>Wilkes Republican</i> in 1848. During the 1860 Democratic convention, Wilson used his paper to support Union-Democrat Stephen Douglas for president. Wilson changed the newspaperâ€™s masthead to the <i>Washington Independent </i>in late 1860 and reduced the size of the paper. In this reduced state, the paper lasted until 1865 when a lack of subscribers made the paper unsustainable."
