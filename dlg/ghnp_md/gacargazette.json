  "essay": "In June 1805, Michael Burke and Alexander M’Donnell entered into a partnership and founded the <i>Georgia and Carolina Gazette</i> in the growing upriver town of Petersburg. Their newspaper published weekly and cost subscribers three dollars a year. Despite Petersburg’s early success, the co-owners struggled to gain steady subscription payments and were forced to suspend the newspaper for a month in November 1805. In December, Burke left the venture to move to Louisville, Georgia, leaving M’Donnell as the sole editor and proprietor. The paper survived at least into August of 1806. The town of Petersburg itself began to decline in 1810 after tobacco farming in Georgia gave way to cotton and the town was no longer a significant stopping point for merchants."
