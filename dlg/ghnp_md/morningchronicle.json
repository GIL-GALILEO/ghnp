  "essay": "The <i>Morning Chronicle</i> was a short-lived daily (triweekly during summer months) newspaper founded in 1817 in Savannah, Georgia. Samuel Ker acted as the publicationâ€™s editor for its two-year run. The paper displayed sheet-sizes and printing styles consistent with its contemporary counterparts. The <i>Chronicle</i> featured international, government, and local columns alongside various advertisements for subscribers who paid the six dollar annual subscription. Other Savannah newspapers of the time proved more popular and the <i>Chronicle</i> ceased circulation in 1819."
