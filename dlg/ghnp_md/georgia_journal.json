	"essay": "Virginians Seaton and Fleming Grantland established the <i>Georgia Journal</i> in Milledgeville in 1809, the same year they moved into town. The paper had a major presence in the earliest years of the state capital and leaned toward the <a href='http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/government-politics/john-clark-1766-1832'>John Clark</a> political faction. The <i>Georgia Journal</i> was so successful during Milledgeville's earliest years, it absorbed smaller publications like the <i>Reflector</i>, which ran independently from 1817 to 1819. In 1847, the <i>Georgia Journal</i> merged with the <i>Georgia Messenger</i> in <a href='http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/counties-cities-neighborhoods/macon'>Macon</a>, which in turn would merge with the <a href='http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/macon-telegraph'><i>Macon Telegraph</i></a> in 1869."
