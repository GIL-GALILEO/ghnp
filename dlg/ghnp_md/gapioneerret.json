  "essay": "S. M. Hood founded one of Cassvilleâ€™s oldest newspapers, the <i>Georgia Pioneer, and Retrenchment Banner</i>, in 1835. He published the paper under that masthead until deciding to shorten the title to <i>Georgia Pioneer</i> in the early 1840s. The newspaper eventually ceased publication in 1845."
