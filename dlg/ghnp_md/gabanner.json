  "essay": "James A. and Frank M. Welch founded the <i>Transcript</i> in 1840 as Newnanâ€™s fourth newspaper. In that same year, the masthead changed to the <i>Georgia Banner</i> with Saxon M. Anderson as the printer. Later, this title became the <i>Georgia Banner and Sentinel</i>. During the antebellum period, the paper served as the legal organ for Coweta, Heard, Carroll, and Meriwether counties. The newspaper ceased publication during the Civil War, but the Welch family played a major role in the founding and continuation of the <i>Newnan Herald</i> in the post-war years."
