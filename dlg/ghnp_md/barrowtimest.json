  "essay": "In 1916, the Times Publishing Company established the <i>Barrow Times</i> as a competitor to the <i>Winder News</i>. The company chose J. C. Flannigan as editor of their weekly Democratic paper, and he remained in that position for three years. By 1918, just two years after its founding, the <i>Barrow Times</i> reported a circulation of 1,300 which rivaled the <i>News</i>’ claimed circulation of 1,448 that same year. Albert G. Lamar, former editor and owner of the <i>Jackson Economist</i> during its Populist days, became lead editor of the <i>Times</i> in 1919. The <i>Times</i> was a close competitor to the <i>News</i> and both papers matched each other with Democratic politics and a similar price increase to a dollar and a half annually in 1920. The <i>Winder News</i> absorbed the <i>Barrow Times</i> in 1921 to form the <i>Winder News and Barrow Times</i>. The newspaper continues today under the title <i>Barrow News-Journal</i> as Barrow County’s legal organ."
