  "essay": "Using a hand press, J.A. Reynolds began publishing the <i>Clayton Tribune</i> in 1897. Clayton's lack of bank or railroad led to paper sometimes becoming scarce; Reynolds was forced to buy wrapping paper from local merchants to use as newsprint to avoid missing a publication. Reynolds owned and published the Tribune until 1914 when he sold the paper to Frank D. Singleton. The <i>Tribune</i> identified itself as Democratic paper and had a circulation of around 1,500 in 1898. Under Singleton's direction, the paper moved to a new building on Depot Street and began using a press operated by electricity. The Depot Street building would come to be called the Tribune building. For a time, the <i>Clayton Tribune</i> ceased publication under that masthead following a merging with the Clarkesville Advertiser. The new masthead was the <i>Tri-County Advertiser</i> and served as the official organ for Rabun, Towns, and Habersham counties. The <i>Clayton Tribune</i> was revived, however, when Singleton leased the <i>Tribune</i> plant to L.P. Cross; Cross released the first issue of the resurrected publication in January 1924. In 1963, after passing through the hands of Eddie Barker and R.E. Cross, the <i>Clayton Tribune</i> was sold to Community Newspapers, Inc. and continues to publish today."
