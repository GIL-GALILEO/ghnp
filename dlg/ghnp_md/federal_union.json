	"essay": "In response to the strongly Troup and Whig-oriented <i>Southern Recorder</i>, Tomlinson Fort, a prominent Milledgeville physician and future mayor of the city, established the <i>Federal Union</i> in 1830. The paper's political leanings viewed unionism over state's rights and would support the Clark Faction and Democratic Party. Competition between the papers was fierce, even to the point of physical confrontation between the editors. By the late 1850s, Milledgeville's newspapers supported the idea of state's rights, but stopped short of calls for secession. Once Georgia and the rest of the South seceded, however, the papers aligned themselves firmly behind the Confederacy. The <i>Federal Union</i>, in January of 1861, removed the American flag from its banner and changed its name to the <i>Southern Federal Union</i>, and would in the following year change its name again to the <i>Confederate Union</i>, a name that would only last until the end of the war. The war forced a shortage of both funds and material for the <i>Federal Union</i> and <i>Southern Recorder</i>. The problem became so significant by 1864, both newspapers were forced to reduce their weekly issues from four pages to two. In November of that year, General William T. Sherman and his forces marched through Milledgeville, forcing the <i>Federal Union</i> to hide its equipment in the forest to prevent its destruction. In 1872, A. J. Orme sold the <i>Southern Recorder</i> to the <i>Federal Union</i> which resulted in their merger and the creation of the <i>Union and Recorder</i>."
