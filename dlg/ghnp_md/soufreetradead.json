  "essay": "The <i>Standard Union and Free Trade Advocate</i> first began publication in Sparta, Georgia in 1833. During its time in Sparta, the weekly newspaper was edited and published by P. L. Robinson, but Thomas Haynes took over those duties when the paper moved to Milledgeville in 1834. Under Haynesâ€™ direction, the masthead became the <i>Standard of Union</i> and remained as such until the paper ceased publication in the mid-1830s."
