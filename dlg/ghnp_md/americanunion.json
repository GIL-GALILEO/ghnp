  "essay": "A.G. Murray established the <i>American Whig</i> in 1845 as an oppositional paper to Griffinâ€™s Democratic <i>Jeffersonian.</i> The paper became the <i>American Union</i> in 1851 due to the decline of the Whig party. The <i>Union</i> editorialized against secession and ceased publication in early 1860s under the financial burden of the war."
