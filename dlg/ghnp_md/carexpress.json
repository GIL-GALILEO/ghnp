  "essay": "Samuel H. Smith, brief editor and proprietor of the <i>Cassville Standard</i>, established the <i>Cartersville Express</i> in 1858 with Dr. W. T. Gold Smith. By 1859, the <i>Express</i> and <i>Standard</i> were in a co-partnership. Much like the <i>Standard</i>, the <i>Express</i> was a Democratic publication, but the two publications differed on the topic of secession. The editors of the <i>Express</i> favored secessionist candidates John C. Breckenridge and Joseph Lane in the 1860 presidential election. Along with the <i>Standard</i>, the <i>Express </i>ceased publication in the early 1860s, but the <i>Express </i>re-opened its doors as a weekly in January, 1865. Samuel H. Smith edited the revived paper while Robert P. Milam acted as the paperâ€™s owner. From 1868 to 1871, C. C. Morgan, Colonel J. J. Howard, and James Watt Harris would serve as co-editors with Smith. In 1871, the <i>Cartersville Express </i>and <i>Cartersville Standard</i> would consolidate under the title <i>Standard and Express</i> under the ownership of Smith, Wikle & Company."
