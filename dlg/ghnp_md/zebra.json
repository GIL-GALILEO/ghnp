  "essay": "Walter Allen, Jr, with the editorial help of Mary Allen and Rick Dunn, established the <em>Zebra Magazine</em> in 1993 as a monthly magazine focused on African-American communities across Georgia. While the administrative offices were located in Athens, Georgia, (first on Davis Street and later Hawthorne Avenue), the magazine covered Clarke, Oglethorpe, Jackson, Greene, Barrow, Walton, Elbert, Wilkes, Morgan, and Madison Counties. Allenâ€™s magazine achieved a circulation of 30,000 and boasted over 100 distribution points across the state of Georgia. This circulation was achieved by keeping the subject matter of the magazine local, with sections like <q>People in the News,</q> and <q>Youth in Action.</q> The magazine originally sold 12 issues for 15 dollars a year, with that price only increasing to 20 dollars a year in much later issues. <em>Zebra Magazine</em>, which also served as a voice for African-American business owners, ceased publication in late 2017."
