  "essay": "Established in the early 19th century, the <i>Hickory Nut and Upson Vigil</i> was Upson County’s earliest publication. George Carey edited the newspaper from 1830 to 1836 in his office above what was Mitchell’s Harness Store at that time. The paper was delivered weekly to subscribers at a cost of two dollars and fifty cents (in advance) or three dollars (by end of the year). By 1837, the <i>Hickory Nut</i> was no longer printing and legal advertisements were published in Macon’s <i>Georgia Messenger</i>."
