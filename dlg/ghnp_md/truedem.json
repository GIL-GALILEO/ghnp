  "essay": "In the 1860 presidential campaign, finding himself at odds with the <i>Constitutionalist</i>’s support for northern Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, James M. Smythe left to establish his own publication. Smythe established his <i>Daily True Democrat</i> on July 18, 1860 to support southern Democrat John C. Breckenridge. A weekly edition, published by William J. Vason, also printed until late 1860. Following Breckenridge’s (and the Democratic Party’s) defeat in 1860, the publication was renamed the <i>Southern Republic</i> in 1860 under the direction of the William J. Vason and Company."
