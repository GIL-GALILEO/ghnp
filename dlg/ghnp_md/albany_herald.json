The paper competed with the daily <i>Albany News and Advertiser</i> until the mid-1890s when the <i>Herald</i>'s popularity put its competitor out of business. The <i>Sunday Herald</i> was established in 1893 and a weekly Saturday edition in 1892. Since its founding, the paper has been a strong supporter of the area's agricultural economy and was only the second paper in South Georgia to provide readers with telegraph news. The Herald continues to circulate in Albany as the city's primary daily newspaper."
