  "essay": "Founded in 1855 by W. V. Wester, the <i>Democratic Platform</i> was the first paper published in Calhoun. G. J. Fain took over editorial duties of the four-page, seven-column newspaper in 1856 and changed the masthead to the <i>Georgia Platform</i>. In 1858, W. V. Wester, still an owner of the publication, changed the masthead to the <i>Valley Register </i>and the title would remain as such until it again changed to the <i>Confederate Flag</i> in 1861. By 1861, the owners were James N. Scott and Jones L. White, but the newspaper did not survive the financial burdens of the Civil War."
