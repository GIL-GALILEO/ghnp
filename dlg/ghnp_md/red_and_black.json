Two years later, the publication was discontinued after a conflict between university faculty and the <i>Red and Black</i>. In September, 1895, the publication resumed as a private venture, which proved successful enough to convince faculty to reclaim the paper in 1896. The University of Georgia Athletic Association assumed control of the <i>Red and Black</i>, which operated there in connection with the School of Journalism. In 1980, the UGA Board of Regents voted to approve the paper's independence from the university. The <i>Red and Black</i> remains an independent publication and is the most widely circulated college newspaper in Georgia."
