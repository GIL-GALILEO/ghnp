Allen began publishing the <em>Berrien County Pioneer</em> in 1888, and moved the newspaper to <a href="https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/counties-cities-neighborhoods/tifton">Tifton</a> in 1891, renaming it the <em>Tifton Gazette</em>. Allen focused much of the newspapers early content to local affairs and county politics. <em>Tifton Gazette</em> employee J. L. Herring purchased the publication in 1896 and served as its editor until his death in 1923. The <em>Gazette</em> began daily circulation in 1914 and continues publication today."
