  "essay": "In 1882, E. J. Christy and R. H. Kinnebrew established the <i>Danielsville Monitor</i> in Danielsville, Georgia. The paper began as a four-page, Democratic weekly at a subscription cost of one dollar. Kinnebrew left the publication in 1885, and, by 1887, W. B. Loehr replaced Christy as sole editor and publisher. Loehr left the paper after two years, and J. B. Moon took over editing and publishing responsibilities in 1889. Kinnebrew returned to the <i>Monitor</i> in 1890 with E. F. McGowan as a partner. Kinnebrew again left the newspaper in 1891, and McGowan found a new partner in B. M. White. White stayed with the paper for less than two years, and McGowan was joined by B. T. Moseley in 1893. Moseley and McGowan were editors and publishers for the paper until 1900 when E. J. Christy returned to replace McGowan. Former owner W. B. Loehr founded the <i>Madison County Argus</i> as a competitor in the same year Christy returned to the <i>Monitor</i>. The <i>Madison County Argus</i> was not an independent entity for long. In December of 1900, it merged with the <i>Monitor</i> under the masthead <i>Danielsville Monitor and Madison County Argus</i>. This arrangement continued until March 1, 1901, when the paper returned to the <i>Danielsville Monitor </i>title. B. T. Moseley and E. J. Christy were the publication’s longest running owners to date until R. C. Ayers replaced B. T. Moseley in 1914. Mr. and Mrs. Ayers were owners and publishers of the paper while Christy remained as editor. The Ayers managed the paper until 1945 when J. C. Ayers took over. The <i>Danielsville Monitor</i> became the <i>Madison County Journal</i> in 2005 and continues today as Madison County’s legal organ."
