Within the publication, Longstreet printed his literary fiction, some of which he would later collect in his <em>Georgia Scenes</em> publication. William E. Jones later owned and edited the <em>Sentinel</em> as a stand-alone paper for a brief period of time. In December of 1836, Jones purchased the <a href='https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/augusta-chronicle'><em>Augusta Chronicle</em></a> from A. H. & William F. Pemberton and merged it with the <em>Sentinel</em>. He renamed the paper the <em>Augusta Chronicle and Sentinel</em> in January of the 1837. It kept the title for the next forty years."
