The daily edition sold at a yearly subscription cost of four dollars while the weekly only required a dollar and a half yearly; the paper self-reported a combined 17,000 daily and weekly subscribers. During its run, <i>The Evening Dispatch</i>'s offices were located on McIntosh Street. In the 1860 presidential election, Atkinson used the paper to support Southern Democrats John C.
