  "essay": "On February 17, 1814, Alexander McDonnell ceased publication of the <i>Georgia Express</i> to establish the <i>Athens Gazette</i> with Reverend John Hodge. The editors indicated they hoped the publication would match the <i>Augusta Chronicle</i> in size and sought a three dollar per year subscription cost. The paper’s history is fraught with financial struggle and, for a time, the owners allowed wheat as a form of payment. In 1815, Alexander McDonnell gave up his shares of the publication and left John Hodge as the sole owner. By March, 1818, Samuel Wright Minor assumed ownership of the <i>Athens Gazette</i>. Although the paper continued publishing through to the early 1820s, the paper’s financial situation limited Minor to publishing irregularly and on significantly reduced sheet sizes. In the absence of a stable paper, legal advertisements were published in Milledgeville newspapers and later the <i>Columbia Centinel</i> in 1825. It was not until O.P. Shaw established the <i>Athenian</i> in 1827 that Athens would have a newspaper suitable enough to be a legal organ."
