  "essay": "The town of Jug Tavern became Winder in 1893 after the town was connected to Atlanta and Athens via the Seaboard Airline Railroad. The same year as the town’s reincorporation, M. D. Irwin and J. F. Sells began publication of a weekly Populist newspaper titled the <i>Jackson Economist</i>. The two partners ran the paper until Albert G. Lamar of the short-lived <i>Georgia Populist</i> purchased the <i>Economist</i> and became sole editor and publisher. Lamar managed the paper until 1907 when he transferred ownership to N. B. Lord and C. H. Cook; at the time of the sale, the paper had a circulation of 1,192 and cost one dollar per year. During the short tenure of these new owners, the masthead of the <i>Economist </i>became the <i>Winder Weekly News</i>. Lord and Cook managed the publication for less than a year before handing the paper over to Robert O. Ross and his brother G. D. Ross in 1909. Under the Ross & Ross Publishers Company, the retitled <i>Winder</i> <i>News</i> moved away from its Populist politics and shifted towards the Democratic Party. In 1920, the company reincorporated as the <i>Winder News Publishing Company</i>.  The Ross brothers were the paper’s longest owners to date as they did not sell the paper until 1921. In 1921, J. W. McWhorter and former owner C. H. Cook purchased the <i>News</i> and maintained ownership until 1934. During their run, the <i>News </i>merged with competitor <i>Barrow Times </i>to form the <i>Winder News and Barrow Times</i>. The paper reverted to the <i>Winder News</i> title from 1925 to 2000. The publication continues today under the title <i>Barrow News-Journal</i> as Barrow County’s legal organ."
