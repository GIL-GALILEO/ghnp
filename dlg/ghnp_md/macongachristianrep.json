  "essay": "G. Capers began publishing the <i>Georgia Christian Repertory</i> in 1831. The weekly newspaper featured literary works of Christian subject matter and Christian communication around the South. The paper cost three dollars a year (in advance) and arrived every Thursday. Domestic and foreign news were given limited space, but the largest amount of reporting revolved around events of the Methodist Episcopal Church. The paper ceased printing in the mid-1830s."
