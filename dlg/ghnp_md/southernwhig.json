  "essay": "In response to the Democratic <i>Southern Banner</i>, political opponents established a rival paper, the <i>Southern Whig,</i> in 1833 to support the principles of the Whig Party. The two papers competed politically and commercially throughout the 1840s. The <i>Southern Whig</i> ceased publication in 1850 (due in part to the declining popularity of the Whig Party) and was revived as the <i>Southern Herald</i>. The <i>Herald</i> lasted just four years, before John H. Christy reformed it into the <i>Southern Watchman</i> in 1854. The paper gave voice to Democratic Party opposition, which was made up mostly of former Whigs and members of the American Party, who were sometimes referred to as the Know Nothings. The political rivalry became particularly prominent in the weeks before secession. After the election of Abraham Lincoln, the <i>Southern Banner</i> joined many other Georgia papers in calling for Georgia's secession from the Union. The <i>Southern Watchman</i>, on the other hand, worked to ease tensions and promoted further compromise between the North and South. Following Georgia's decision to secede in January of 1861, the <i>Watchman</i> fell in line with the <i>Banner</i> and called for unity within the state. In 1865, the <i>Watchman</i> took an opposing viewpoint to the <i>Banner</i> by coming out against conscription. The <i>Southern Banner</i> and <i>Southern Watchman</i> merged in 1882 to become <i>The Banner-Watchman</i> and in 1889 became the <i>Athens Banner</i> The <i>Athens Banner</i> combined with the <i>Herald</i> in 1923 to become the <i>Athens Banner-Herald</i>."
