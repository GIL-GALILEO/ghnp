  "essay": "On April 25, 1888, Joseph Barton published the first issue of the <i>Banks County Observer</i> in Homer, Georgia. The publication became Banks County’s first legal organ which allowed the Athens <i>Banner-Watchman</i> to drop that responsibility. Barton edited and published the weekly paper with J. W. Sumpter as printer. On January 23, 1889, the <i>Observer </i>became the <i>Farmer’s Journal</i>. This new name lasted only eight months before becoming the <i>Weekly Journal</i> on September 12, 1889. With Sumpter’s printing press firmly established by 1889, printing job advertisements began appearing in the pages of the <i>Journal</i>. In early April of 1890, after running the paper for two years, Barton left to pursue a job in the railroad industry. Reverend T. O. Rorie edited the paper from April 10 to May 1, but the <i>Weekly Journal </i>ceased publication in that first week of May of 1890."
