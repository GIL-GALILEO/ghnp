	"essay": "The <i>Southern Field and Fireside</i>, founded in 1859, was an agricultural and literary paper published in conjunction with the <i>Augusta Constitutionalist</i>. Colonel James Gardner, publisher of both, intended for the paper to supplement the <i>Constitutionalist</i> with additional information. With the help of press manager John L. Stockton and editor W. W. Mann, the <i>Southern Field and Fireside</i> was remarkably able to maintain publication throughout the civil war. Despite this success, Gardner sold the publication to Mr. Smith of Raleigh North Carolina in 1864 and the paper would eventually cease publication by 1865."
