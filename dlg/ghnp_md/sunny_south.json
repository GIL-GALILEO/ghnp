The paper printed stories of prominent southern authors and covered the news of the state. In 1893, the <i>Atlanta Constitution</i> purchased the magazine and published it as supplement to the Sunday editions of the <i>Atlanta Constitution</i>. The <i>Sunny South</i>, during this period, was the first publication in Atlanta to support the cause of suffrage for women. Celebrated writer and journalist <a href='http://www.newgeorgiaencyclopedia.com/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-525'>Joel Chandler Harris</i> absorbed the <i>Sunny South</i> into his new publication, the <i>Uncle Remus Magazine</i> in 1907. He died the following year, but his paper continued circulation under the direction of his son until 1913.</p>"
