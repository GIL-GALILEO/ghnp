  "essay": "Canton’s first newspaper was the <i>Cherokee Mountaineer</i> founded in 1861; the publication only lasted a year or two. It would not be until nearly twenty years later that a newspaper found a foothold in Canton. This paper, the Democratic leaning <i>Cherokee Advance</i>, was founded by twenty year old Mr. Ben F. Perry in January of 1880. Perry sought to increase Canton and Cherokee County's sense of community by reporting on local events. In 1885, just a day before the next <i>Advance</i> was due, Perry delayed printing so that he could travel to and report on devastation of a cyclone that struck the northern part of the county. The four column account proved to be a motivating factor in bringing aid to the region. In 1888, Perry successfully lobbied for Canton to be the location of the Georgia Press Association's annual meeting. Following the event, he reported a full account which included H. W. Newman's “The Georgia Cracker” speech. The <i>North Georgia Tribune</i> editors credited the Cherokee Advance with making the most significant impact on the progress of Canton and Cherokee County out of all the county's early publications."
