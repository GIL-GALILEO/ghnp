  "essay": "The <i>Upson Pilot</i> was founded by editor and owner G. A. Miller in late 1858 with Jas. R. Hood as publisher. By 1861, the newspaper faced a shortage of materials which resulted in a reduction of sheet and type size. Due to financial difficulties imposed by the American Civil War, the <i>Pilot</i> advertised that it would take items such as firewood or chickens as a form of payment. Assistant editor T. C. Rhodes took full control of the publication in December of 1861 during G. A. Millerâ€™s absence; Benjamin Bethel assisted Rhodes by taking over printing duties. Rhodes left in 1861 to serve in the Confederate Army and the paper eventually ceased publication by early 1862."
