  "essay": "James Van Ness founded the weekly <i>Columbus Times</i> on February 11, 1841. Ness, Columbus’ postmaster since 1828, was editor and proprietor of the <i>Times</i> until his retirement on April 10, 1844. John Forsyth and William L. Jeter then operated as co-owners of the newspaper. Jeter sold his share of the <i>Times</i> to former <i>Macon Democrat</i> editor Marcus Johnson in April, 1843. General James N. Bethune became involved with the paper in the mid-1840s and remained as publisher until Roswell Ellis and Company purchased the <i>Times</i> in 1849. Under Ellis, the <i>Times</i> experienced significant growth in scope and circulation. In 1852, with co-owner and former <i>Enquirer</i> editor Tennant Lomax, Ellis merged the <i>Times</i> with William H. Chamber’s <i>Southern Sentinel</i> to form the <i>Weekly Times and Sentinel</i>. In 1853, the two owners introduced a tri-weekly edition of the <i>Times and Sentinel</i> which they continued until 1858. R. Ellis and Company, with editorial assistance from Peyton H. Colquitt and James W. Warren, again expanded their paper to include a daily edition titled the <i>Columbus Daily Times</i>. On the topic of secession, the largely Democratic <i>Times</i> fell in favor of breaking from the Union which put the publication at odds with the <i>Columbus Enquirer</i> and some of the staff at the <i>Daily Sun</i>. The <i>Times</i> published weekly and daily editions until October, 1865, when the <i>Daily Sun</i> absorbed the <i>Times</i>."
