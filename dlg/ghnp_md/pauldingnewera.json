  "essay": "In 1882, William Breckenridge began publishing the <i>Paulding New Era</i> in Dallas, Georgia, the same year the first railroad ran through the city. It was the most successful newspaper in Paulding County until the early 1890s, when it faced competition from the Populist Party-alligned <i>Dallas Herald</i>. The <i>New Era</i> emerged victorious, however, as the Herald eventually ceased publication due to the decline of the Populist movement. The paper was retitled the <i>New Era</i> for a short time before becoming the <i>Dallas New Era</i> in 1898 and has retained that title into the present. It remains the oldest business in Dallas."
