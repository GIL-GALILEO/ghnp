	"essay": "Seaton Grantland and Richard Orme, both of whom had previously worked on the <i>Georgia Journal</i>, began printing the <i>Southern Recorder</i> in February of 1820. The paper leaned politically toward the state's rights doctrine and became an extremely successful publication in the state capital. The <i>Southern Recorder</i> supported the Troup Faction and Whig Party throughout the antebellum period. The publication's principal rival was Tomlinson Fort's <i>Federal Union</i> with competition fierce enough to reach physical confrontation between editors. By the late 1850s, despite its strong state's rights orientation, the <i>Southern Recorder</i> published articles suggesting that compromise was possible and preferable. Once Georgia and the rest of the South seceded, however, Milledgeville's papers aligned themselves firmly behind the Confederacy. The <i>Southern Recorder</i> and <i>Federal Union</i> remained rivals until 1872 when <i>Recorder</i> owner, A. J. Orme sold the paper to the <i>Federal Union</i>; this sale resulted in the papers merging to create <i>Union and Recorder</i>."
