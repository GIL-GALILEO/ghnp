	"essay": "Dooly County's first newspaper began as the <i>Dooly County Vindicator</i> in 1875 with C.D. Rainey and J.A. Dupree as its founders and first editors. Seven years later, under the editorship of John E. Howell, the <i>Vindicator</i> became the <i>Vienna Progress</i>. The paper ran without local competition until 1901 when T. A. Adkins established the <i>Vienna News</i> as the city's second major newspaper. The two publications operated as separate entities, the Progress published on Thursdays and News on Fridays, until 1903 when H. D. Smith sold controlling interest of the <i>Progress</i> to Mr. Adkins. Adkins chose to consolidate the papers, keeping the <i>Vienna News</i> masthead. A subscription to either newspaper was one dollar and both publications were aligned with the Democratic Party; when the two combined, the <i>Vienna News</i> began issuing semiweekly, on Tuesdays and Fridays. In addition to local fare, the early twentieth century issues of the newspaper provided agricultural advice, serial literature, international culture, and the latest in American fashion to its Dooly County subscribers. Adkins would become Vienna's postmaster in 1914 and he sold the Vienna News to C. S. Gurr and L.L. Woodward in 1915. Emily Woodward, who served as editor of the <i>Vienna News</i> in 1916 and took over sole ownership of the paper two years later, broke ground as the first woman elected to serve as president of the Georgia Press Association in 1927. Woodward continued ownership of the <i>News</i> until 1933 when she sold the paper to C.M. Methvin. The paper merged with the <i>Unadilla Observer</i> in 1975 and became the <i>Vienna News-Observer</i>. Since 1986, the paper has been published as the <i>News-Observer</i>."
