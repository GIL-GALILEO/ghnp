  "essay": "The <i>Southern Literary Gazette</i> was a short-lived literary magazine published in Athens from 1848 to 1849. William C. Richards, founder of the <i>Orion</i> in 1842, moved from Penfield to Athens in the early 1840s and established the <i>Southern Literary Gazette</i> on May, 1848. Richards wanted to focus his literary paper on the works of southern writers.  The paper featured essays by the editor, poems, and short stories, with a single column dedicated to reporting news. Among poem writers were Mrs. Joseph C. Neal and Leila Cameron (Richards’ sister-in-law and sister).  Works by Charles Dickens and Walt Whitman also found their way into the eight-page weekly newspaper. Southern writers that were featured include William Gilmore Simms, Mary E. Lee, Robert M. Charlton, Henry Rootes Jackson, J. M. Lagaré, Thomas Holley Chivers, Carolina Lee Hentz, and Joseph Addison Turner.  On May 5, 1849, Richards changed the masthead to the <i>Richards’ Weekly Gazette</i> and expanded the interests of the paper beyond the literary.  The publication moved the Charleston, South Carolina, in 1850 after Joseph Walker purchased a co-owning stake."
