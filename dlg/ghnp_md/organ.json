  "essay": "B. F. White, noted author of the <i>Sacred Harp Song Book</i>, began the <i>Organ</i> newspaper in January 1852. White tried to keep the paper politically neutral and reported on a wide array of subjects including art, science, education, morality, and music. Whiteâ€™s background in music could be found in the pages of the <i>Organ</i> as many of the editorials discussed music and printed songs. The paper ceased publication in the mid to late 1850s."
