  "essay": "Co-editors McIntyre and Millen founded the <i>Darien Gazette</i> in 1818 as Darienâ€™s first weekly newspaper. The publication featured regular columns devoted to local events, state political activity, and regular shipping news. McIntyre sold his interest to John Millen, who incorporated the paper and maintained management until the early 1820s. Charles F. Grandison owned and edited the <i>Darien Gazette</i> from 1824 until its closure in 1828."
