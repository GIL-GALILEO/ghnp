	"essay": "The publication began as the <i>Temperance Banner</i> in <a href=\"http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/counties-cities-neighborhoods/washington\">Washington</a>, Georgia in 1834, before moving to Penfield in the early 1850s. In the decade that followed, publisher Benjamin Brantley changed the paper's title several times, which was known at various points as the <i>Temperance Crusader</i> and the <i>Georgia Temperance Crusader</i>.  Colonel John H. Seals purchased the paper and moved it to Atlanta in the late 1850s. He changed the name to the <i>Georgia Literary and Temperance Crusader</i> in 1859. As the title implies, the paper was a literary publication that advocated for temperance. The paper continued publication in Atlanta until the war forced its suspension in 1864."
