  "essay": "John K. M. Charlton purchased the <i>Monitor</i> in Washington, Georgia in January of 1815 and combined the publication with his newly created <i>The Friend</i> to create <i>The Friend and Monitor</i>. Charlton changed <i>The Friend and Monitor</i>’s masthead to the <i>News</i> in January of 1816. When Charlton bought interest in the <i>Augusta Chronicle and Georgia Gazette</i> in 1820, Phillip C. Guieu became editor and proprietor of the <i>News</i>. In 1821, Guieu changed the masthead to the <i>Washington News</i>. Guieu maintained the paper until 1826 when he sold out to Thomas A. Pasteur. Pasteur served as editor and proprietor of the paper until the early 1830s when he sold the <i>Washington News</i> to William A. Mercer who edited the paper while Jesse Mercer acted as publisher. In 1832, Mercer changed the masthead to the <i>Washington News and Miscellaneous Advertiser.</i> The Mercers owned and edited the paper until 1837 when, citing financial struggles, they sold out to the paper’s rival, the <i>Southern Spy</i>."
