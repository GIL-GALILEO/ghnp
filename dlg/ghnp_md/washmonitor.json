  "essay": "Washington’s first newspaper, the <i>Washington Gazette,</i> was founded in 1800 by former state printer and publisher of Augusta’s <i>Southern Centinel and State Gazette,</i> Alexander McMillan. In June, 1801, David Hillhouse purchased the <i>Washington Gazette</i> and changed the masthead to the <i>Monitor</i>. Hillhouse served as editor and publisher of the newspaper until his death March 24, 1803. Hillhouse’s wife, Sarah Porter Hillhouse, became the first female newspaper editor in Georgia when she took over editorial and publishing control following her husband’s death. The <i>Monitor</i> ran under the same title for twelve more years, publishing state and European news copied from Augusta papers and following local events; In January of 1815, John K. M. Charlton purchased the <i>Monitor</i> and combined it with his newly established<i>The Friend</i> to create <i>The Friend and Monitor.</i>"
