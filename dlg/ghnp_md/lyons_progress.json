In 1911, the twelve page paper reported a circulation of 1,076 and cost subscribers one dollar per year. The <i>Progress</i> merged with the <i>Vidalia Advance</i> to become the <i>Advance-Progress</i> in 1991. That same year, the publication became Toombs County\'s legal organ and the <i>Advance</i> continues to serve Toombs, Montgomery, and Lyons counties today."}
