  "essay": "The <i>Wire-Grass Reporter</i> became Thomasville’s second newspaper on September 15, 1857, filling a gap left behind by the <i>Georgia Watchman</i>. Judge Peter E. Love and William H. Hall were the newspaper’s first owners and editors with Hall eventually replaced by William Kline. For its brief existence, the Democratic publication was a fierce rival to the <i>Southern Enterprise. </i>Kline left the paper to work for the <i>Enterprise</i>, and the <i>Wire-Grass Reporter</i> ceased publication before the Civil War."
