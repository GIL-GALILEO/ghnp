  "essay": "Athens, incorporated in 1806, received its first printing office when Reverend John Hodge purchased a printer from Philadelphia and attempted to start a religious and literary newspaper.  Due to Hodge’s poor health, he sold the printing press to associate printer, Alexander McDonnell. Alexander McDonnell, along with co-owner Elias Harris, created Athens’ first newspaper on March 14, 1808, with the weekly <i>Georgia Express</i>.  In July, 1809, the paper’s masthead read <i>Foreign Correspondent and Georgia Express</i> as the owners began incorporating foreign news reports and expanded the size of the publication. Elias Harris sold his shares of the newspaper to McDonnell, and McDonnell would be sole owner and editor until he brought on Xenophon Gaines in 1811 as an assistant editor. The <i>Express</i> continued until 1814 when McDonnell entered into business with former newspaper editor John Hodge to found the <i>Athens Gazette.</i>"
