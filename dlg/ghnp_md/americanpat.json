  "essay": "John S. Mitchell and Charles W. Pratt established the <i>American Patriot</i> as a semi-weekly in Savannah on April 14, 1812, by. The paper adhered to the principles of Washington and Hamilton and strongly leaned Federalist. Mitchellâ€™s editorials were often political in nature and spoke out against anti-federalists. Mitchell notably opposed the mobilization of Georgia military towards Spanish-held Florida. These conspicuous editorials drew enough ire that Mitchell was attacked in May, 1812. He continued to publish his newspaper, however, and chose to carry two pistols. Despite assertions that he would continue publication in the face of such opposition, Mitchell published the final issue on June 5, 1812."
