  "essay": "Simpson Fouche, later a representative for Floyd County at the 1861 Georgia Constitutional Convention, began publishing the <i>Southerner</i> in 1849 in Rome, Georgia. With the assistance of G. P. Hamilton, the publication came out weekly and featured local and national news alongside editorial comment. Fouche voiced strong opposition to the 1850 compromises set forth by Henry Clay, and frequently included secessionist discussion in the pages of his paper. With his increased involvement in Georgia politics, Fouche ceased publication of the <i>Southerner</i> in the early 1850s."
