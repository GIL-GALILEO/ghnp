  "essay": "Major Philip C. Pendleton established the <em>South Georgia Times</em> in <a href=\"https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/counties-cities-neighborhoods/valdosta\">Valdosta</a> in 1867 as a weekly publication and ran the paper for two years before dying from injuries sustained after being thrown from a horse. His sons took over ownership and retained control throughout most of the 19th century. In 1874, the Pendletons renamed the publication the <em>Valdosta Times</em>. The newspaper was incorporated under the Valdosta Times Publishing company in 1889, with Charles R. Pendleton serving as president of the company. Charles G. Brantley became editor of the <em>Times</em> after Mr. Pendleton was replaced by D. C. Ashley as president of the Times Publishing Company. The paper began daily circulation in 1905 under the <em>Valdosta Daily Times</em> name to serve the growing population of Valdosta and served as a strong advocate for the city's burgeoning agriculture and industry. The paper continued publication through the twentieth century and continues to serve the citizens of Lowndes County today."
