  "essay": "Titus Powers and Gurdon Seymour published the first issue of the <i>Columbian Museum and Savannah Advertiser</i> on March 8, 1796. The <i>Museum</i> was a more successful rival to the <i>Georgia Gazette</i> than the <i>Georgia Journal and Independent Federal Register</i> and lasted for over two decades. The <i>Museum</i> became Savannah’s sole newspaper for nine months when a fire wiped out the offices and printing press of the <i>Georgia Gazette</i> on November 24, 1796. The <i>Museum’s</i> offices were also lost, but the newspaper was able to publish a single-sheet issue on November 29 about the fire. By October 5, the <i>Museum</i> returned to full-size again and, during the <i>Gazette’s</i> downtime, became the largest newspaper in Savannah. On February 3, 1817, Titus Powers and Gurdon Seymour turned their <i>Columbian Museum and Savannah Advertiser</i> into Savannah’s first daily paper. The owners achieved this by merging with the tri-weekly <i>Savannah Gazette</i> to form the <i>Columbian Museum and Savannah Daily Gazette</i>. The paper lasted for five more years before the <i>Savannah Georgian</i> and <i>Savannah Republican</i> proved more popular. The <i>Museum</i> ceased publication in 1822 under the masthead <i>Savannah Museum</i>."
