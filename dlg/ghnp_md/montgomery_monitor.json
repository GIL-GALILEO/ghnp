  "essay": "In 1886, the <i>Montgomery Monitor</i> became the first newspaper published in the small pine timber town of Mount Vernon. For a dollar and a half per year, one could expect their four page paper every Wednesday. Future town councilman D. C. Sutton established the paper as a Democratic publication seeking to both report on town events and represent the interests of Montgomery County. Sutton and the future editors of the <i>Monitor</i> were vocal opponents of carving out new counties from Montgomery land; notable are editorials against the formation of Toombs County in 1905 and Treutlen County in 1915. On April 25th, 1895, the <i>Monitor</i> celebrated over 2,000 subscribers. A. L. Ryals took over as editor in May of 1899 and fulfilled his promise of doubling the publication\'s page size as well as improving the paper\'s appearance and content; for the first time, the paper published syndicated international and state-wide news. B.W. Pullen, N. L. Stafford, D. W. and H. B. Folsom, all spent time editing the <i>Monitor</i> in the twentieth century. The <i>Montgomery Monitor</i> still serves the communities of the Montgomery County area today."
