  "essay": "On June 18th, 1908, the <i>Montgomery Monitor</i> reports the founding of the Toombs County Local in Vidalia, Georgia. Editor P.A. McQueen and manager R. Don McQueen produced the Democratic paper together until P. A. McQueenâ€™s death in 1911. McQueen took over as editor and, along with the McQueen and Dunham Publishing Company, maintained the <i>Toombs County Local</i> until the popularity of the <i>Vidalia Advance</i> forced the closure of the publication in 1914."
