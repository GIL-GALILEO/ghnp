  "essay": "On June 18th, 1908, the Montgomery Monitor reports the founding of the Toombs County Local in Vidalia, Georgia. Editor P.A. McQueen and manager R. Don McQueen produced the Democratic paper together until P. A. McQueenâ€™s death in 1911. McQueen took over as editor and, along with the McQueen and Dunham Publishing Company, maintained the Toombs County Local until the popularity of the Vidalia Advance forced the closure of the publication in 1914."
