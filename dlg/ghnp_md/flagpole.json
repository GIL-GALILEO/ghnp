	"essay": "Flagpole Magazine began publication in 1987 in Athens, GA as the \"Colorbearer of Athens Alternative Music\" and quickly expanded its content to include politics, art, theater, movies, books, food, local comics, and advice columns. For three decades, Flagpole has held a mirror to Athens life and has kept the community informed about what happened, what's happening and what's going to happen. The publication remains independent and locally-owned and is distributed weekly free of charge, while also being available online at <a href=\"https://flagpole.com/\">flagpole.com</a>. Flagpole, a member of the national Association of Alternative Newsmedia, now calls itself, simply, \"Colorbearer of Athens\" and is supported by its mostly local base of advertisers."
