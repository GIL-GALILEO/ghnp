Flagpole quickly expanded its content to include politics, art, theater, movies, books, food, local comics, and advice columns. For three decades, Flagpole has been a mirror on the local culture the city of Athens and its thriving arts scene. The publication remains independent and locally-owned, and is now edited and published by Pete McCommons, who joined the paper in 1993. Under the banner \"Colorbearer of Athens, Georgia,\" the Flagpole is distributed weekly and free of charge and has become a local institution and an irreplaceable source of news for local Athenians and music lovers alike."
