  "essay": "The <i>Clarke County Courier</i> was a weekly newspaper established by J. E. Gardner. The four-page paper was first published in 1900 at a subscription cost of 50 cents, but by 1903 the price had increased to a dollar. Gardner, who owned and edited the paper for its entire existence, aligned his paper with the politics of the Democratic Party and in favor of prohibition. The paperâ€™s peak self-reported circulation was 1,200, but, by its final year, circulation was reported at 1,000. Gardner ceased publication in 1913."
