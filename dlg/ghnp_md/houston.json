	"essay": "<p>John T. Waterman founded the <i>Houston Home Journal</i> in Perry in December 1870. The paper strongly aligned with the Democratic Party during Reconstruction and notably opposed Tom Watson’s Populist Party. Beginning in 1877, the publication’s title shifted several times between Houston Home Journal and Home Journal, before finally settling on the former in 1924. Perry-native John H. Hodges purchased the paper in 1880. The Hodges family maintained ownership of the publication for over sixty years, before selling it in 1946. The Houston Home Journal remains the legal organ for Houston County and continues semiweekly publication as the county’s oldest continually-operated business.</p>"
