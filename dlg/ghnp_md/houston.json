	"essay": "<p>John T. Waterman founded the <i>Houston Home Journal</i> in Perry in December 1870. The paper strongly aligned with the Democratic Party during Reconstruction and notably opposed <a href='http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/thomas-e-watson-1856-1922'>Tom Watson</a>'s <a href='http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/populist-party'>Populist Party</a>. Beginning in 1877, the publication's title shifted several times between <i>Houston Home Journal</i> and </i>Home Journal</i>, before finally settling on the former in 1924. Perry-native John H. Hodges purchased the paper in 1880. The Hodges family maintained ownership of the publication for over sixty years, before selling it in 1946. The <i>Houston Home Journal</i> remains the legal organ for Houston County and continues semiweekly publication as the county's oldest continually-operated business.</p>"
