  "essay": "S. T. Chapman began the <i>Savannah Courier</i> in 1852 with both weekly and daily editions. In less than a year, Chapman entered into a partnership with J. B. Cubbedge of the <i>Savannah Evening Journal</i> to form the <i>Savannah Daily Journal and Courier.</i> The newspaper was suspended upon Chapmanâ€™s death in 1854 but revived when R. B. Hilton purchased the publication. Hilton changed the masthead to the <i>Savannah Daily Journal</i> which remained the title until merging with the <i>Savannah Georgian</i> in May 1856 to form the <i>Savannah Georgian and Journal.</i> The paper underwent a title change in 1857 when A. R. Lamar published the paper as the <i>Savannah Daily Georgian</i>."
