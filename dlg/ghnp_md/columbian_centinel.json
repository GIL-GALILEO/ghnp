	"essay": "In 1838, William Tappan Thompson, author of the 1843 Major Jones's Courtship, founded Georgia's first exclusively literary paper titled the <i>Augusta Mirror</i>. Thompson was a staff member under Judge Augustus Baldwin Longstreet at the <i>State's Rights Sentinel</i>, and Longstreet's influence can be felt in Thompson's southern humorist writing. For the extent of the Mirror's short life, the publication's banner would read \"A Semi-Monthly Journal Devoted to Polite Literature, Useful Intelligence, and the Arts.\" In 1842 Thompson merged the <i>Mirror</i> with the <i>Macon Family Companion</i> to create the <i>Family Companion and Ladies Mirror</i>; the paper would cease print by early 1843."
