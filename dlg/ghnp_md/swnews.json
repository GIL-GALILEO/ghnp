Robinson was the paper’s next editor for about a year before leaving to join the Confederate army. On June 1, 1861, Atlanta’s <i>Daily Locomotive</i> editor A. B. Seals purchased the <i>South-western News</i>. Seals changed the masthead to the <i>Americus Weekly Post</i> and continued as editor and owner until the newspaper ceased publication in 1862."
